<p>Emily&rsquo;s middle name may be in honor of Edward&rsquo;s sister who died over a decade before Emily was born. Presumably she went by Emily in casual circumstances to distinguish her from her mother, and in more formal contexts, she typically used &ldquo;M. Emily Mills&rdquo;, particularly in later years.</p>
<p>Emily was baptized in the Reformed Dutch Church of Port Richmond. Other than this even, I do not have direct evidence of Emily attending church prior to her Brookton baptism.</p>

<p>Documentation suggests the Mills family moved from Staten Island to Corfu sometime between 01 Sept 1862 and 01 May 1863, a period overlapping Emily&rsquo;s fourth birthday.</p>
<p>The family moved to Motts Corners in Mar 1879, a few months after Emily&rsquo;s 20th birthday, and in the few years immediately following her brother Horace&rsquo;s suicide.</p>
<p>Emily is mentioned in the will of her uncle:</p>

<p>Emily returned to Corfu in later years to bury Jonas, Mary Ann and Edward. But she also returned to visit her friends, at least this one time, surely with many mixed emotions.</p>

<p>Only a few pieces of evidence survive of Emily&rsquo;s earliest years in Mott&rsquo;s Corners/Brookton. She joined the existing “High Bridge Lodge No. 296” of the <a href="https://memills.com/family-of-edward-hallock-mills/topics/temperance/">Independent Order of Good Templars</a> shortly after arriving in Mott’s Corners, as she &ldquo;furnished entertainment for the good of the order&rdquo; in August 1879. (20 Aug 1879, Ithaca Daily Journal, Ithaca NY, p4.) She was a member until at least August 1886, as attested by the meeting minutes of the Good Templars at that time. She often contributed to the “Good of the Order” portions of meetings in which members volunteered in advance to contribute something of educational and/or entertainment value, such as reading a poem or essay. At different times, she held offices in the lodge, such as secretary, as indicated below, showing one of many examples of her distinctive handwriting.</p>

<p>The Good Templars&rsquo; meetings were both entertaining and educational by design, to offer a compelling alternative to drinking establishments, and clearly, this provided opportunities for Emily to socialize and even travel, as the Good Templars commonly attended events at other Lodges in Tompkins County, cooperated with other temperance groups like the Sons of Temperance, and they sent representatives to the state &ldquo;Grand Lodge&rdquo; as well. Because of this, Emily may be present in some of the well known photographs of <em>other</em> temperance groups in Caroline.</p>
<p>At least by the 1890&rsquo;s, Emily was working as a clerk in her father&rsquo;s store, just as her older brothers had. (She may have always helped with the store, or perhaps she only began clerking in the store after Jonas died.) Several volumes of sales journals have survived from <a href="https://memills.com/family-of-edward-hallock-mills/topics/me-mills/">M. E. Mills general store</a> that are written by Emily&rsquo;s hand (and certainly Ellen Gould&rsquo;s handwriting must also be present in those books).</p>
<p>Many aspects of Emily&rsquo;s handwriting are quite distinctive—such as uppercase E&rsquo;s, M&rsquo;s, W&rsquo;s, C&rsquo;s, T&rsquo;s and F&rsquo;s as well as lowercase p&rsquo;s are often written with similar idiosyncrasies. Note for example, the following page of entries in M. E. Mills sales journals, which appears to be entirely written by Emily.</p>
<figure class="image" style="max-width:800px;"><img src="/family-of-edward-hallock-mills/assets/images/me-mills/1909-03-26-sales-journal_hu2478392875bd683b069d8cdee232ad83_974574_800x0_resize_q75_box.jpg" width="800" height="1637" alt=""><figcaption>

<p>Her E&rsquo;s C&rsquo;s L&rsquo;s and J&rsquo;s tend to have big loops. Her lowercase p&rsquo;s practically pierce the line above it. And her uppercase T&rsquo;s and F&rsquo;s have distinctive crosses that rise and fall. Her handwriting is easily recognizable, and when others (most likely Ellen Gould) make entries in the Mills&rsquo; store journals, the differences are apparent.</p>
<p>Interestingly, her T&rsquo;s are sometimes written quite differently. See for example, the way &ldquo;to&rdquo; is written in the entries for John and James Caveny vs. those for J. T. Miller and Emily herself. These very different looking T&rsquo;s appear to all be written by Emily given other matches that can be verified, including most obviously, the capital J&rsquo;s which all begin in the center with an extra initial loop.</p>
<p>Jonas died on 14 October 1885 after a brief illness. Whether Emily worked in the store prior to Jonas&rsquo; death, by 1892, she lists herself as clerk in the state census.</p>

<p><strong>Event occurred in Brookton, Tompkins County—Interment at Corfu.</strong></p>
<p>Corfu, Dec 31.—The remains of Mrs. E. H. Mills of Brookton, Tompkins county, arrived here on the 4:26 p. m. train yesterday and were interred in Evergreen Hill Cemetery. The deceased was the wife of Edward H. Mills who was for many years a prominent merchant in this village who removed to Tompkins county sixteen years ago, re-engaging in mercantile pursuits, and where he has since resided.</p>
<p>Mrs. Mills was in usual health a week ago yesterday morning, but before night complained of a soreness in one of her fingers. Her daughter examined it and found what appeared to be a small splinter of wood, which she removed and which appeared to relieve her, but blood poisoning ensued and she continued to grow worse until Saturday, when death relieved her of her suffering. Her remains were accompanied by her husband and an only daughter, Emily Mills, who alone survive her and who possess the heartfelt sympathy of many friends in this vicinity who remember her as a kind friend and a devoted Christian whose sublime faith made her life beautiful and to the last degree exemplary.</p>
<p>Mr. Mills and daughter spent last night with Mr. and Mrs. W. W. McGregor and returned home this morning.</p>

<p>In 1907, Emily was baptized and officially joined the membership roll of Brookton Congregational Church, along with 10 other single women, in a ceremony officiated by Reverend Annis Ford Eastman. A closer examination of the circumstances around the baptism can be found <a href="https://memills.com/family-of-edward-hallock-mills/topics/baptism/">here</a>. It is unclear what Emily&rsquo;s religious outlook was before being baptized, but at least from that point on, Emily&rsquo;s faith was a very important part of her life.</p>

<p>Emily, along with many of the others baptized with her, immediately became deeply involved in church activities, a level of commitment they sustained the rest of their lives. Emily was a Sunday School teacher, and possibly taught classes specifically for adults. There are newspaper accounts detailed below of her organizing bible study groups and prayer meetings in her home. In the following report, dated the eve of Edward&rsquo;s death, we see that in the months immediately after joining the church, Emily taught a class with an average attendance of five students:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/162726499/gertrude-l-conant">Gertrude Conant</a> (19 Jul 1924 to 04 Sep 2007) mentions that Emily played the piano or organ in the Church. The church historical records, as one would naturally expect, cover topics unevenly over the years. Concerning the piano/organ: there was an organ in the church at one time, but it was destroyed by mice. The roles of pianist/organist and that of assistant pianist/organist, were for a time at least, positions that were voted on at the annual meetings just as officers such as secretary and treasurer were. I have not found any references for Emily being in either of those roles, but there are many years where these roles are not noted at all, so unless Gertrude is mis-remembering, without her noting this detail, it would be lost. (Anna Mulks and Cassie Landon were several times noted in these roles.)</p>
<figure class="quote-only">
<blockquote> 
Originally a pipe organ stood on a raised platform (for choir) at the back of the auditorium. After it deteriorated (with assistance from the church mice) a piano was used. During the pastorate of Rev. James L. Burckes (1949-1955) the platform was eliminated and double entrance doors cut in the curving wall. Prior to that time there had been only a single entrance door at each side of the wall.

<p>Emily continued to be involved in temperance into the 1900&rsquo;s, and for some period of time, she was a member of the Women&rsquo;s Christian Temperance Union, along with her step-mother Hannah. This is almost certainly unknowable now, but I have wondered if Hannah was introduced to Edward through the Emily&rsquo;s involvement with temperance. This may also be how Emily knew Ellen Gould. It is interesting to note that the Brookton chapter of the W.C.T.U. was organized in 1907—the year of Emily Mills&rsquo; and Jessie (Shurter) Brewer&rsquo;s baptism—and that Jessie is also active in the W.C.T.U.</p>

<p>Edward died &ldquo;intestate&rdquo;, without a will, and it wasn&rsquo;t until July 1909 that Emily and Hannah, working with their lawyer Fordyce Cobb, became official legal co-owners of the Mills&rsquo; home and Mills&rsquo; store assets. Emily followed her father&rsquo;s example and renamed the store M. E. Mills. When Hannah passed less than a decade later, Emily inherited all assets and property.</p>

<p>Emily Mills was a little woman, with her hair in a bun on top of her head, like Grandma Bacon’s. She was quiet, neat, cheerful and always smiling.</p>

<p>Emily fell and broke her hip while on her way to services at Brooktondale Congregational Church on 10 Oct 1937. She spent the last several weeks of her life in Memorial Hospital in Ithaca where she died on 03 November, a few weeks shy of 79 years old. Presumably, she was the first in her family not to die at home (with the possible exception of Horace). Like her father, Emily died without a will.</p>

<p>This moving tribute was authored by E. D. Shurter, a Brookton native who was at different times, an attorney, a college professor and a nationally renowned orator and author. This is Emily&rsquo;s only known obituary and is referenced elsewhere as such:</p>

<p>To the Editor of The Journal:</p>
<p>The recent death of Miss Emily Mills, a long-time resident of Brooktondale, deserves more than passing notice. For some thirty years she conducted at this place the general store in which she formerly served as helper to her father.</p>
<p>Reserved, unostentatious, and kindly, she aided materially the Caroline welfare director by extending credit for groceries to many needy individuals. Paraphrasing the remarks of Robert G. Ingersoll at his brother&rsquo;s funeral: If everyone to whom Miss Mills extended a helpful hand were to place a floral emblem upon her grave, she would sleep today amidst a wilderness of flowers.</p>
<p>A devoted member of the Congregational Church at this place, teacher in the Sunday School, she went about her daily round of duties with a Christian fortitude and faithfulnes that were greatly appreciated and will be long remembered by her host of friends who join in this tribute to the memory of one who, even as her great Exemplar, went about doing good.</p>
<p>E. D. Shurter,
Brooktondale</p>

<p>The professor clearly took great care in crafting this tribute, and with the pacing of the final sentence, one can sense the weight of responsibility he felt representing the sense of loss of an entire community who held Emily in equally high esteem. He is Emily&rsquo;s first and most eloquent biographer, without whom we wouldn&rsquo;t fully appreciate some of the most important aspects of Emily&rsquo;s life, most notably, her charitable acts.</p>
<p>The news clippings above give examples, such as her contributions to the Red Cross, and of course, the W.C.T.U. did considerable charitable work. In the M. E. Mills store sales journals, there are entries indicating direct donations from the store that Emily counted against her own account as &ldquo;Goods for Charity&rdquo;:</p>

<p>Emily was the last in the line of Edward H. Mills, and it seems that her family&rsquo;s story has become unknown to the Mills of subsequent generations.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/160363879/mary-emily-mills">Emily</a> is interred at Brookton (formerly Quick) Cemetery at the corner of Landon Road and Lounsbery Road in Brooktondale NY, 14817.</p>
<p>As one is standing in front of the Emily&rsquo;s headstone, with back to the cemetery entrance on Lounsbery Road, the ground is disturbed on the left side of the two plots purchased for Emily, indicating where she rests. As is the case with Hannah, the date of birth on Emily&rsquo;s headstone is incorrect:</p>

<p>Furthermore, in her entry in the 1900 US census, Emily indicates her birth date is &ldquo;Dec 1858&rdquo;. The census data I have seen is presently limited to what is available online through ancestry.com, but among those I was able to find during Emily&rsquo;s lifetime, only the 1900 census asked for month and year of birth, while all others, including 1900, simply ask for age at last birthday. Census&rsquo; were typically done in May or June of the appropriate years, and Emily&rsquo;s self reported age in each census consistently resolves to 1858 as indicated in the &ldquo;Computed birthyear&rdquo; column above.</p>

<p>I have been in contact with two people at Brookton Cemetery who have both looked into the matter, and they each confirmed that the only information they have on Emily is the name and plot number &ldquo;and what is on the headstone&rdquo;. There is no indication who made the funeral arrangements for Emily, who the plot was sold to, or any information that might shed light on the erroneous birth year. Emily&rsquo;s grave stone is the only documentation I have with this birth year other than subsequent histories that were written using the grave stone as the source for her birth year.</p>
<p>That the birth year on Emily&rsquo;s grave is incorrect suggests Emily&rsquo;s final arrangements were made by one or more people in Brooktondale, likely someone from the Congregational Church, Jessie Brewer being the most likely candidate, although E. D. Shurter is another possibility. This further implies that Emily no longer had contact with any Mills family descendants on Long Island, which seems to be supported by the potential heirs sought out after her death as noted in the <a href="https://memills.com/family-of-edward-hallock-mills/mills-home/other-past-owners/">Mills&rsquo; home</a> deeds.</p>
<p>Further research will obviously need to be done, but ultimately, Emily&rsquo;s exact date of birth (and that of her brothers) may be lost, as she was born during a notoriously bad period for the recording and preservation of birth records. In addition to the usual sources, I submitted a reference question to the staff of the Presbyterian Historical Society, but they were unable to find records for Mary Ann or her children. (Much of the Church&rsquo;s digitized records are actually available via ancestry.com, and in fact, entries can be round for Edward&rsquo;s sister Emily Tabitha Mills for example.) I have also submitted requests to the New York State Department of Health vital records as well as the New York City Department of Records and Information Services, and in both cases so records for Emily&rsquo;s birth were found. It is interesting to note however that according to <a href="https://ldsgenealogy.com/NY/Staten-Island-Birth-Records.htm">ldsgenealogy.com</a>, there are potentially many microfilm records for Richmond County (Staten Island) during this time period.</p>
<h2 id="other-historical-accounts">Other Historical Accounts</h2>
<p>Understandably, histories of the Mills family have typically focused almost exclusively on Emily. All previous secondary sources of information on Emily accepted 1861 as her birth year.</p>
<p>Emily is mentioned twice by Molly Adams (1936 to 23 Jun 2014) in her chapter &ldquo;Town of Caroline&rdquo; in <em>The Towns of Tompkins County: From Podunk to the Magnetic Springs</em> edited by Jane Marsh Dieckmann:</p>
<blockquote class="quote_only">
...[George Jansen] noted the death of Emily Mills, who had continued her father's store for thirty years, extending credit to many needy individuals. (p62)
</blockquote>
<p>As indicated elsewhere, George Jansen predeceased Emily by two years. The entry that Molly must have been referring to is the mention of Edward&rsquo;s death:</p>

<p>Emily is not mentioned by name, but is implicitly referenced in a photo caption of a portrait of Jessie Brewer published in 2016, &ldquo;Around Caroline&rdquo; by Patricia A. Brhel, p23:</p>
<blockquote class="quote-only">
Jesse Brewer ran a dry goods store in Brooktondale, selling fabric, ribbon, greeting cards, and other items. She took over from a woman who had managed a grocery store in the same building and used the proceeds from the store to increase the family income and help support her widowed mother. She was also active in the Caroline Valley Federated (now Community) Church.
</blockquote>
<p>Gertrude Conant&rsquo;s personal recollections provide valuable details, including physical descriptions of Emily and her store as well as reflections on her personality. If not for Gertrude, these precious details would be long forgotten.</p>
<figure class="image" style="max-width:800px;"><img src="/family-of-edward-hallock-mills/assets/images/conant-gertrude-1_hue765127666cfbf8e6469d7251c4ddc99_920684_800x0_resize_q75_box.jpg" width="800" height="973" alt=""><blockquote><p>Emily Mills&rsquo; store was in the building where the Post Office is today. I remember it as a dark place with long rows of counters on each side and tables and glass-topped counters in the middle. Emily Mills was a little woman, with her hair in a bun on top of her head, like Grandma Bacon&rsquo;s. She was quiet, neat, cheerful and always smiling.</p>
<p>She had yard goods, bias tape, combs, lace handerchiefs, and many things you could buy for presents for ten cents and up. There were racks of thread, needles, pins and all the things we needed for our 4-H projects.</p>
<p>She had groceries, and took butter and eggs in trade. Butter was weighed on her scales. The scales had a large scoop at one end, and little weights at the other. I don&rsquo;t remember her selling meat, but she probably did. Many people had kerosene lights then, and she sold it by the gallon. You took your container, and she filled it, usually with a potato on the end so it wouldn&rsquo;t spill. Marilyn and I would go do the shopping for Aunt Mina, with a cart in the Summer and a sled in the Winter to carry them home with.</p>
<p>Miss Mills also taught Sunday School at the Congregational Church and played the piano. It must have been a class for older people, as I never had her for a teacher.</p>
<p>I remember her as very kind, and I was shocked to learn someone had stolen things from her while she was busy with another customer.</p>
<p>She lived across the street from Dr. Lockwood, in a little house that sat back near the hill. Her father had the store before her. Apparently she never married. She had a woman who lived in and kept house for and cooked the meals, and would stay in the store while she ate lunch and supper. I can&rsquo;t remember her name, but she looked a great deal like Miss Mills.</p>
<p>After Miss Mills died, Jessie (Shurter) Brewer had a notions store here. No groceries, just sewing supplies, hosiery and a few dresses, etc. She also had a lending library in the back, where I found many western and mystery stories to read. She ran the store for some time, and I always enjoyed shopping there and talking to her. She had a bell on the door, that rang next door so she could come over when she had customers.</p>
<p>Upstairs the building had a long hall, with a stage at one end. There were outside stairs leading to the second floor, but I had not noticed much about it, until a traveling show had a performance here. Many buildings in the village had such &ldquo;halls&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Today the Postoffice is in this building and the upstairs is an apartment.</p>

<p>Shortly after I moved into the Mills&rsquo; home in Brooktondale, Molly Adams visited me to sign me up for the Old Mill newsletter, and to give me the following history of Emily Mills and her store. I have since been told that this was a ritual Molly performed with other newcomers. Although I read this &ldquo;Note&rdquo; with some interest initially, I didn&rsquo;t appreciate its importance until several years too late to ask Molly to teach me more. I at least had the foresight to save it somewhere I could find it again years later when I needed it. I revisit this often, still mining it for clues about Emily, trying to learn what Molly knew. Despite its title, this exceptional account is more about the M. E. Mills store than it is about Emily herself. As I&rsquo;ve done my own research, it does seem that much of what is known about Emily is in relation to the store in some way, and perhaps that is to be expected.</p>

<p>Before David VanDeMark&rsquo;s mother Grace died, he had found in her sewing
machine (which had been acquired from Clara Lockwood) a little leatherette booklet
labeled on the outside &ldquo;M. E. MILLS, DEALER IN DRY GOODS, GROCERIES, HARDWARE
AND CROCKERY, BROOKTON, N.Y.&rdquo; On the inside is a calendar covering July 1909 to
July 1910, a pack of needles and a fabric needle holder. The text says &ldquo;This is a
complete set of needles for all purposes. All the best imported. We would very much
appreciate your patronage when anything in our line is needed.”</p>
<p>Mary Emily Mills, known as Emily, was born in 1861 and died in 1937. In the
1892 Census she is listed as a &ldquo;clerk&rdquo; in her father&rsquo;s store. Emily&rsquo;s father was Edward
H. Mills, who died January 1, 1908, leaving &ldquo;stock and accounts of a going, general
merchandise business in the village of Brookton&rdquo; and a parcel known as “the Mills
Store lot,” valued at $500. Edward Mills died without a will, and Emily was appointed
executor of the estate, being more competent for such business than her elderly
mother Hannah, The estate was settled in August, 1909, so the little sewing booklet
represents Emily Mills’ first attempt at advertising after she took over the store.</p>
<p>The Mills Store was located in the building which Brooktondale residents know
today as the &ldquo;old postoffice,&rdquo; across the street from the TNT. Mr. Mills had operated a
store for 29 years (and was postmaster during the Cleveland administration), but we
don’t know if it was always in this location. The family lived across the street in a
house built on &ldquo;part of the Grist Mill Lot&rdquo; [the Grist Mill foundation supports the
current Dalebrook Apartments]. In 1891 the house was owned by Esther Vorhis, but
was occupied by E. H. Mills &ldquo;as tenant.&rdquo; The house lot was measured starting at &ldquo;the
Center of the bridge crossing the Mill race.&rdquo; The property was sold to Mr. Mills by
Edward and Amanda Lounsbery in 1903.</p>
<p>Emily Mills died in 1937, having kept the store with its &ldquo;kerosene, kerosene
lamps with green shades, penny candy, stockings, handkerchiefs, yard goods, pins
and sewing notions, sheets and pillowcases&rdquo; (and groceries) all that time. Her
obituary notes that she &ldquo;aided materially the Caroline welfare director by extending
credit for groceries to many needy individuals.&rdquo; Jessie Brewer, who had grown up in
the house next door as Jessie Shurter, bought the store and Emily&rsquo;s house and
continued the business, adding a lending library in the back room. In 1961, Charles
Vorhis bought the store and moved the post office across the street from the current
TNT Market, where it had occupied the side addition.</p>

<p>The date of these notes suggests that perhaps the &ldquo;Note&rdquo; that Molly gave me was something she created specifically for whoever the new owner of the Mills&rsquo; home would be, and was designed specifically to pique interest in Emily.</p>
<p>The answer to Molly&rsquo;s question &ldquo;and some groceries?&rdquo; seems to be yes. Perhaps the question arose because Jessie Brewer apparently did not continue to sell groceries, and this was what residents of the time would more likely remember.</p>
<p>Emily is also mentioned in Town of Caroline Historian Barbara Kone&rsquo;s compilation &ldquo;A History of the Town of Caroline, Tompkins County, New York, United States of America&rdquo; known to us all as &ldquo;The Bicentennial Book.&rdquo;</p>

<p>One of my main goals is to find photos of the family and their stores, but my highest priority is Emily. No known photos of the family exist. I know of only one person still living who interacted with Emily, and that person says their memory would not be good enough to identify Emily in a photo.</p>
<p>In Gertrude Conant&rsquo;s recollections, she notes that Ellen Gould &ldquo;looked a great deal like Miss Mills,&rdquo; so when looking for photos of either woman, one must be cautious not to mis-identify one for the other.</p>
<p>There is an intriguing photo in &ldquo;Around Caroline&rdquo; by Patricia A. Brhel that shows a woman minding a general store, with no indication which general store in Caroline it is:</p>

<p>My sense is that this is probably not Emily, but obviously this needs to be investigated further. Barbara Kone believes that this photo did not come from the Caroline History Room. I have contacted Patricia Brhel who is checking her notes for information on this photo, and she suggests that is it likely a store in Speedsville or Caroline Center.</p>
<p>I believe that the reference to &ldquo;Bertha Mills&rdquo; in the 1914 American Agriculturist Farm Directory shown below is in fact a misprinted reference to Emily. I have yet found no evidence of a Bertha Mills in Brookton at that time, and everything but the reference to the road on the map in that volume fits Emily. As for the map reference, consider that the same road reference is given for Dr. Lockwood and Frank Mulks, Emily&rsquo;s neighbors on what is now Brooktondale Road, and who are listed on the same page:</p>

<li><a href="https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/100334891/bertha-k-caveney">Bertha K. Caveney</a> (1886 yo 1960), approximately 28 in 1914.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/97218399/bertha-ross">Bertha (Pritz) Ross</a> (1876 to 1964), approximately 38 in 1914.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/98912296/bertha-beard">Bertha (Bogardus) Beard</a> (1873 to 11 Aug 1944), approximately 41 in 1914.</li>
</ul>
<p>And Emily is the only Mills in Caroline at that time that I am aware.</p>
<p>My own speculation after reading many of the Ithaca Journal &ldquo;gossip columns&rdquo; from Emily&rsquo;s lifetime is that there may be a decent probability that Emily, or someone very close to Emily, was the author of these during a period that included the final years of Hannah&rsquo;s life. The fact that Hannah was written of so much and in such glowing terms, and the tone and subtle phrasing of references to Hannah&rsquo;s life, are very suggestive.</p>
<p>For example, consider the similarity in wording to the gossip column on 17 Jan 1914, Ithaca Journal: &ldquo;Mrs. Mills is a remarkable woman&hellip;&rdquo;  and Hannah&rsquo;s obituary, presumably written by Emily, on 27 Feb 1917, Ithaca Journal: &ldquo;Mrs. Mills was one of Brookton’s oldest and most respected citizens and a remarkable woman.&rdquo; Consider also the similarity in the phrases &ldquo;&hellip;who was for many years a prominent merchant in this village&hellip;&rdquo; in the 31 Dec 1895 Daily News of Batavia and the 24 Nov 1906 Ithaca Daily Journal article that refers to Edward as &ldquo;&hellip;for many years a prominent merchant of Brookton&hellip;&rdquo;. (Although other aspects of the 31 Dec 1895 article suggests it was written by someone other than Emily.) Hannah and Edward are in several different instances referred to as &lsquo;aged&rsquo; although that in itself is unremarkable. Consider too the level of detail, in say, the obituary for Mary Ann.</p>
<p>Typically, the gossip columns had a default headline of the area, in this case &ldquo;Brookton&rdquo; or occasionally &ldquo;Brookton Heights&rdquo;. However, there are times when a bigger headline was added emphasizing one aspect of the column. These have the initial appearance of a typical newspaper article, but upon reading, it becomes clear it is the relevant gossip column for that day, with perhaps a little more detail on the topic mentioned in the headline. This was the case with a few of Hannah&rsquo;s entries.</p>
<p>In an informal discussion on the topic with Barbara Kone, it seems unlikely that &ldquo;Brookton Heights&rdquo; was ever a name used in the community. The &ldquo;Brookton Heights&rdquo; columns are indeed about the people of Brookton, and Barbara suggested that adding &ldquo;Heights&rdquo; was someone&rsquo;s attempt to dress up the name.</p>
<p>These gossip columns, it is my understanding, were written by people local to the areas they were reporting on, and over time, you can sense a shift in style, level of detail, who is reported on, etc. that suggest periodic changes in authorship. Brookton was not an enormous community, so it isn&rsquo;t highly improbable that Emily could have been the author for a period. Emily spent all day, every day at the center of the community, within one of its active hubs, and was well placed to observe people&rsquo;s activities.</p>
<p>Further, consider these:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Emily was &ldquo;Superintendent of Literature and Publications&rdquo; for the W.C.T.U. Why that position?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Consider how the store and church are mentioned, perhaps most notably, in the column where the glasses were left at the Congregational Church, and could be retrieved at M. E. Mills.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The meeting minutes of the Good Templars that she recorded.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Presumably she wrote Hannah&rsquo;s obituary.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Very rarely were authors acknowledged for the gossip columns. In an informal discussion about the gossip columns with Donna Eschenbrenner, it sounds like that The Ithaca Journal significantly downsized in the recent past, some of their records were sent to their parent company in Binghamton, while the rest were simply discarded, so it is very unlikely that any record of who the various &ldquo;gossip column&rdquo; authors were still exists.  I have tried to contact the Ithaca Journal to follow up on possible records but have not been able to get a response back.</p>
<p>Finally, I should point out the obvious role that Jessie Brewer played in preserving at least some of the information available here. She appears to have purchased all of Emily&rsquo;s personal and real property at auction, and so apparently, she is the first link the chain of custody for many of the surviving artifacts.</p>
<p>Consider for example that the 1917 W.C.T.U. Directory at the Tompkins County History Center is one of several dozen in the collection, yet it stands out as all of the others are from many years later. Isn&rsquo;t it curious that to my knowledge, this is the only documentation proving that Emily had been a member of the Union? (Although the gossip columns covering Hanna and Ellen strongly suggest she was, as one would expect her to be anyway.) I made note of the accession information from the Tompkins County History Center but there was no obvious connection to Emily or Jessie, but I suspect that this could have originally been in Emily&rsquo;s and then Jessie&rsquo;s possession.</p>
<p>As for the Good Templars meeting notebook, according to Donna Eschenbrenner &ldquo;Unfortunately we don&rsquo;t have an accession number on that ledger, so we don&rsquo;t know the donor.&rdquo; But again, I believe this was a possession of Emily&rsquo;s for many decades. She was the secretary for the final entry in the notebook, and the related items, forms, correspondences, etc., are all in Emily&rsquo;s hand, very strongly indicating that she was the last active member of the Templars to possess the notebook.</p>
<p>The final entry on 27 Aug 1886 seems routine, and there is no indication that the group was disbanding. The fact that there are correspondences and forms along with the notebooks could be an indication of unfinished work in progress, but of course all of this assumes that the letters and correspondences were together and not donated independently. But I believe that based on what exists, a compelling case can be made that at least some of these items were in Emily&rsquo;s possession for many decades.</p>
<p>Assuming that Emily had these items in her possession when she died then it logically follows that Jessie Brewer had the next hand in preserving these items. And if this argument holds, then this may give us insight into the depth of their relationship, intertwined over many years. I suggest that once Jessie had purchased all of Emily&rsquo;s property, she must have been deeply moved to see Emily&rsquo;s distinctive handwriting and so, she made a point of saving these items. And of course, having purchased Emily&rsquo;s store, Jessie Brewer was initially responsible for preserving the sales journals of M. E. Mills, and perhaps when they were finally removed from the basement, they were still in the place that Jessie had put them years before. This may also explain why the only books known to be preserved are those following Edward&rsquo;s death, when Emily took his place.</p>
