Note that for the properties presented, the deed history should be assumed incomplete. I have followed the deed histories only as far as I am able at any given time, and because I am most interested in data of clear historical value, I have chosen in some instances to not include such things as appropriations, boundary line agreements, etc., unless they are themselves directly relevant to what is being investigated.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
