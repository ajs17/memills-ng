                <p>The following is the research I accumulated on Robert Mills prior to determining that he was likely out-of-scope for this work. As far as I can tell, <a href="https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/77507182/robert-mills">Robert Mills</a> (17 Nov 1824 to 11 Dec 1890) is not a descendant of Timothy Mills of Mills Pond, although he may be a descendant of John Mills &ldquo;who was made freeman of Boston in 1632&rdquo;. (Genealogies of Long Island Families, p105.)</p>
<p>Robert Mills and James D. Warren were both among the elite business men of Buffalo at the same time, and both were very active in Republican politics, so the two men must have been well acquainted.</p>

<p>END OF A LONG AND USEFUL LIFE.</p>
<p>Sketch of His Career on the Lakes and as a Builder of Vessels—His Pelitical Life and Service as Police Commissioner—Personal Characteristics.</p>
<p>Ex-Police Commissioner: Robert Mills, died at his residence on Prospect avenue, at 5:25 this morning. The immediate cause of death was a stroke of apoplexy, which he sustained on Monday evening last. He became unconscious, and so continued to the end. Mr. Mills had been an invalid for the past eight years, owing largely to the effects of a stroke of paralysis.</p>
<p>Robert Mills was the son of Scotch parents, who emigrated to Canada in 1823. He was born Noy. 17, 1824, in Toronto, where his early boyhood was spent. He came to Buffalo when twelve years of age and shipped as a cabin boy on the schooner John E. Hunt, running between Buffalo and Chicago. He rose by degrees, and at the early age of 21 years he was given the position of master of the brig Uncle Sam. Afterwards he became half owner of the brig Philadelphia, his first venture in ownership, and he was made master of the vessel. He followed life on the lakes with considerable success, becoming in turn master of the schooner George Davis, the brig Hampton and schooner Hope. He was owner of the latter vessel and part owner of the Kate L. Bruce. He built the schooner P. P. Pratt and sailed it for six years. In 1855 he quit sailing and went into business on land. He and Patrick Walsh, forming the firm of Mills &amp; Walsh, started a shipyard. They bought out the shipyard and drydock of F. N. Jones in 1866, the firm then being Mills &amp; Co., the partners being Mr. Mills, Mr. Walsh,and John Rice. Mr. Walsh died in 1875, but his heirs continued his interest in the firm.</p>
<p>Until about eight years ago, when his health failed, Mr. Mills was one of the most prominent builders and operators in lake vessels at this port. His firm was very successful. They ran two large docks and built many of the finest vessels on the lakes. Among them are the Wyoming, Monteagle, Robert Mills, Florida, and others.</p>
<p>But it was not alone in ship-building that Mr. Mills achieved distinction. He went into politics in 1859, obtaining the election of alderman on the republican ticket in the Eighth ward in spite of the fact that the ward was then democratic by 300. He was re-elected in 1861 and defeated by eleven votes in 1863. He was a good republican and an excellent alderman. In 1861 President Lincoln appointed him steamboat inspector for this district and he held the position four years.</p>
<p>Captain Mills was chairman of the Republican County Committee from 1868 to 1874, serving with credit to himself and his party. In 1871-2 he was Canal Collector at this port. Mayor Brush appointed him Police Commissioner upon the reorganization of the Police Department in 1880. In this position he was best known to the younger men of the city, though his old comrades of the deck and dock never quite got the hang of calling him “Commissioner.” It was plain &ldquo;Captain&rdquo; with them. Captain Mills’ career as a member of the Police Board was an honorable one, He was a faithful official, and it was largely through him that the Buffalo Police Department was brought to a high state of efficiency. He continued in office during the term of Grover Cleveland as Mayor, and when the latter became Governor the police law was repealed.</p>
<p>Captain Mills was married in 1845 to Margaret A. Cherry, of Chautauqua county. Three children were born to them— two sons and one daughter. All are living, His wife also survives him.</p>
<p>In religion Captain Mills was a Presbyterian, treading in the footsteps of his Scottish parents. He attended Lafayette street church. He was a member of Hiram Lodge, F. &amp; A. M., also of Buffalo Chapter, and Hugh de Payens Commandery.</p>
<p>Captain Mills was bluff and hearty in manner, very frank and outspoken. He never &ldquo;beat about the bush&rdquo; in his transactions with men. He was honorable in all his dealings. He won respect and confidence from all with whom he came in contact. The friendships he made lasted through his life, and it will be a grief in many Buffalo homes today to learn that Robert Mills is dead.</p>

<p>Death of Robert Mills.</p>
<p>The grim reaper has been cutting a wide swath among Buffalo’s old and prominent residents. Added to the list of numerous well-known and valued citizens, who have recently closed long lives of usefulness which were closely identified with the prosperity and progress of the city, is Robert Mills, who died about 5:30 o&rsquo;clock yesterday morning, at his home on Prospect Avenue. In his time he was an active business man and capable public official He was always a genial, companionable gentleman. For the last eight years he had been an invalid, the consequence of a paralytic attack. Last Monday evening he was smitten with: apoplexy, which destroyed consciousness, and he did not rally from the stroke.</p>
<p>Mr. Mills was born in Toronto on the 17th of November, 1824, being the son of Scotch parents who immigrated to Canada in the previous year. In that city his childhood was passed. When only 12 years old he came to Buffalo, and shipped as cabin-boy on the schooner John E. Hunt, which plied between this port and Chicago. From then until broken health compelled his retirement from all pursuits, be was associated with the interests of the great lakes, as sailor, master, vessel-owner, and ship-builder, At the early age of 21 he was captain of the brig Uncle Sam, and a little later he was master and became half owner of the brig Philadelphia. In turn thereafter he commanded the schooner George Davis, the brig Hampton, and the schooner Hope. He was owner of the latter craft, and also part owner of the schooner Kate L. Bruce, Then he built the fine schooner P. P. Pratt, which he sailed for six years, and until 1855, when he quit the sailor’s life and formed a partner ship with the late Patrick Walsh to carry on the business of ship-building. In 1866 they bought out the yard and drydock of F. N. Junes, on the south side of Buffalo River. The firm was then Mills &amp; Co., comprising Mr. Mills, Mr. Walsh, and Capt. John Rice. After Mr. Walsh’s death in 1875, his interest in the business was retained by his heirs. Mr. Mills continued in active service until, as has been stated, he was eight years ago prostrated by paralysis. The firm was successful, and with a wide reputation for promptness and excellent work; many fine vessels were built at its yards.</p>
<p>For a long time Mr. Mills was quite conspicuous in local polities, beginning his political career in 1859, when as a Republican he was elected Alderman for the almost invariably Democratic Eighth Ward. He was re-elected in 1861, but in 1863 was defeated, by only three votes. Appointed Inspector of Steam Vessels for this district by President Lincoln in 1861, he held that office for four years. From 1868 to 1874 he was chairman of the Republican County Committee. For 1871 and 1872 he was Canal Collector. Upon the reorganization of the Police Department in 1880, Mayor Alexander Brush appointed him Police Commissioner. He served in that capacity through Grover Cleveland&rsquo;s term as ‘Mayor, and until legislated out during Mr. Cleveland’s administration as Governor. That was his place in the public service,</p>
<p>In 1845 Mr.  Mills was married to Margaret A. C. Cherry of Chautauqua County, who, with their three children, two sons and a daughter, survives him. He was a member of Hiram Lodge, F. and A. M., Buffalo Chapter, R. A. M., and Hugh de Payens Commandery of Knights Templar. Mr. Mills was firm in his convictions, rather blunt in his manner, but, as has been said, of kindly disposition, and he was respected for his intelligence as well as his integrity. His loss is a loss to the city.</p>

<p>DEATH OF ROBERT MILLS</p>
<p>The many friends and acquaintances of Robert Mills were pained, though not surprised, to hear yesterday that he was dead. His demise occurred early yesterday morning, after suffering for several days from apoplexy. Mr. Mills had been an invalid for several years, from a stroke of paralysis.</p>
<p>Robert Mills was born in Toronto, Ont., on November 17, 1824, his parents coming from Belfast, Ireland, a year before. His early schooling was very limited, as his parents were poor and required his assistance to aid in the support of the family. At the age of twelve years Robert came to Buffalo, and at once shipped as cabin-boy on the schooner John E. Hunt, which plied between this city and Chicago, and from that day to the day of his death his life had been closely associated with the marine interests of Buffalo.</p>
<p>From his humble position as cabin-boy Mr. Mills gradually rose to the deck, and, after, filling every subordinate position on ship, was at the age of 21 years made captain of the brig Uncle Sam, having a capacity of 35,000 bushels. He was the youngest vessel-master on the lakes—a fact to which in late years Mr. Mills always referred with considerable pride. When he left the brig Uncle Sam he was placed in command of the schooner Philadelphia with a capacity of 5,000 bushels, and of this ship he was half owner. This was the first vessel in which Mr. Mills had a proprietary interest. He was after then master of the schooner George Davis, the brig Hampton, the schooner Hope, which he owned exclusively; also the schooner P, P. Pratt, and the Kate L. Bruce.</p>
<p>In 1855 Mr. Mills, after 19 years of sailing life, left active service, and established a floating dry-dock in this port with Patrick Walsh, under the firm name of Mills &amp; Walsh, and in 1866 the firm bought the ship-yard and dry-dock of F. N. Jones and engaged in repairing and building lake craft. At the same time the firm was increased by J. Rice. and was known as R. Mills &amp; Co. In 1875 Mr. Mills’s partner. Patrick Walsh, died, but his heirs retained the interest in the firm, and the firm name has remained unchanged to this day.</p>
<p>In his political life Mr. Mills was an ardent and earnest Republican. Positive in his opinions, on political questions, he never lacked the courage of his convictions, and because he believed in Republican principles he never wavered in his devotion to the interests of his party. His first appearance in public life was in 1860, when he was elected alderman from the Eighth Ward, carrying one of the strongest Democratic Wards of the city. He was reelected in 1861 and was defeated in 1863 by just eleven votes. While alderman. Mr. Mills was appointed by President Lincoln, in 1861. as steamboat inspector for this district and he held this office until 1865. In 1868 he was chairman of the Republican County Committee and continued so until 1874. In 1871 and 1872 he was Canal Collector at this port and discharged the duties of this office as he did all others, with honor and credit to himself. In 1880, upon the reorganization of the Police Department, he was appointed Police Commissioner by Mayor Brush, and he served in this capacity with great earnestness.</p>
<p>Mr. Mills’s domestic life was happy. In 1845 he married Margarette A. Cherry of Chautauqua County, and three children—two sons and one daughter—resulted from this union, all of whom survive him. In early life Mr. Mills adopted the Presbyterian faith and was a member and regular attendant of Lafayette street Presbyterian Church. He was a member of Hiram Lodge. Buffalo Chapter, and Hugh De Payen Commandery.</p>
<p>The funeral will take place from the family home, No. 286 Prospect Avenue, on Saturday at three o&rsquo;clock.</p>

<p>At a meeting of the Board of Police yesterday afternoon resolutions were adopted in memory of the late ex-Commissioner Robert Mills, and it was decided to attend the funeral in a body.</p>
<p>A special meeting of the Buffalo Excelsior Marine Benevolent Association was held last evening. Capt. Alexander Clark presided. After announcement had been made of the death of Capt. Robert Mills, Capt. Clark appointed Capts. Thomas Collins, P. J. Kenny, Martin Niland, and William Dickson as committee to draft a memorial. The following, submitted by the committee, was adopted unanimously:</p>
<p>By the death of Capt. Robert Mills the sailing community and lake commerce generally has lost a steadfast and valuable friend. As master for many years he was true to the interests of all who served aboard ship. He always stood up for the rights of the common sailor, and by such his taking-off will be greatly deplored.</p>
<p>In a practical way he assisted largely in building up the commerce of the great Jakes, and especially of Buffalo. As a ship builder his good work lives after him. He was one of the earliest to engage in the construction of vessels for what has now grown to be an immense traffic.</p>
<p>Capt. Mills was a man of warm feelings and strong convictions. As husband, father, friend, he was kind, noble, generous. To his family his death has proved an irreparable loss, but they have the consolation afforded by the spotless reputation he has left behind him.</p>
<p>Resolved, That this memorial be engrossed on the minutes of the Buffalo Excelsior Marine Benevolent Association, and that as a mark of our esteem, the members attend in a body the obsequies of our departed friend.</p>
<p>The funeral of the late Captain Robert Mills took place this afternoon from the family residence 286 Prospect avenue. There was a large attendance of friends of the deceased. The bearers were Messrs. Hamilton Mills, M. C. Mills, John Rice, Albert Sikes, John Humble and Thomas Walsh.</p>

There was about them an air of quiet self-possession, and they impressed one with the idea that they were in the habit of doing well whatever they undertook, These men frequently have full charge of property worth from a hundred thousand to half a million dollars, under trying conditions, and they have the entire confidence of their superiors. They were members of the association of lake masters, and they were on the Way to pay a last tribute to the remains of Capt. Robert Mills, whom they all had learned to esteem for his many noble qualities and the helpful interest he had taken in lake commerce. Such a tribute means something.</blockquote><figcaption>

<p>An Admirable Man who was Always Successful.</p>
<p>Very few old Buffalonians will be unable to recognize the strong face in our it to-day of the late Robert Mills, who died on December 11th. He was a self-made man. A cabinboy on the lakes at the age of twelve years, captain of a vessel at the age of 21, and owner of a vessel a few years later, he rose steadily and rapidly because of honesty, and ability and perseverance. In 1855, at the age of 31, Mr. Mills left the sailor&rsquo;s life and established a dry dock. That was the beginning of the large interests centered to-day about the firm of R. Mills &amp; Co.</p>
<p>Mr. Mills&rsquo;s integrity counted in political life as it had in business life. He was an earnest and unwavering Republican. His first appearance in politics was his election to the Common Council from a strong Democratic ward. From 1868 till 1874 he was chairman of the Republican County Committee. In 1871 and &lsquo;72 he was canal collector of this port. In 1880 he was appointed Police Commissioner by Mayor Brush. His public service was an honor to him and to the city.</p>
