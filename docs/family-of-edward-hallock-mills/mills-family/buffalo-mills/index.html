<p>This section introduces the family of William Mills, a first cousin of Edward Mills&rsquo; father Jonas Davis Mills, who lived in western NY during a time that overlaps with the time Edward Mills&rsquo; family was living in Corfu NY, likely less than 20 miles away.</p><p>Portraits of William Mills&rsquo; family were digitally scanned by Queens Public Library archives Jun 2022 from print photographs in their collection: The Mills Family of Jamaica and Mills Pond, Long Island, Archives at Queens Library, Queens Borough Public Library. The backs of the photographs were also scanned and are shown beside the fronts. The following is my attempt to identify the subjects of these photos and provide historical context for their lives.</p><p>First a note on the process I used to make my determinations, which involves a few simple assumptions as well as judging probabilities and a process of elimination in addition to the direct physical evidence of the photographs.</p><p>To begin, I regard as proof of identify either direct identification on the photographic media itself, or a clear match to a different identified portrait of the people in question, which fortunately, are both satisfied for James D. Warren and his son Orsamus George Warren. The identifications of the portraits with California imprints are compelling based on their unique overlap with the known family history of Daniel and Martha Helme Baker.</p><p>I am also considering the portraits as at least a loosely related set, which is shakier ground given that we don&rsquo;t know exactly how they came to be preserved originally. A Mills or Warren descendant may have donated Mills family photographs along with those of other ancestors that are not related to the Mills or Warrens. The more recent history of the portraits is clearer, however, as they were in a Mills family collection at the Buffalo History Museum along with other items related to William and Deborah Mills and their son James Harrison Mills, before being transferred to Queens Public Library. I will also make a case for separately identifying Deborah and William in the portraits of the two older individuals, despite no direct evidence on the photographic media themselves for viewing them as a couple.</p><p>Therefore, based on the portraits that can be identified, and what is known of the related families in western New York at the time, that the remaining portraits are more likely than not other Mills or Warren family members, and if that is true, it suggests that the likelihood of identifying them increases the closer we are to the subjects of the portraits that can be identified. With this in mind, I will focus on first degree relatives of James D. Warren and his two wives, Laura Love and Mary Mills, including in-laws married to those first degree relatives. Within this set of candidates, the vast majority can be eliminated for various reason that will be shown, and that, along with the direct evidence provided by the photographs themselves, will point to the most likely identities.</p><p>These portraits are typical examples of <em>Cartes de Visite</em> or visiting cards, also called &ldquo;card portraits&rdquo; among several other similar and commonly used names, and in the 20th century they began being referred to by the acronym CDV. CDVs were typically 2.5"x4", and judging the sizes of these particular Mills family portraits based on the scanned image metadata, the average size is 2.4"x3.97".</p><p>CDVs replaced earlier tintypes and daguerreotypes, formats which resulted in unique photographs that could only be copied by photographing the original photograph. CDVs were produced by exposing photographic paper to a glass negative and then mounting the thin paper on a stiff card, and as a result, it was possible to create multiple copies of a single photograph for the first time. The paper was also much less expensive than the previous media, were easier for the customer to handle, and CDVs created higher quality images and looked more elegant as well, and due to technological advances of the time, exposures could be completed in as little as one second or less in bright light. All of these factors, along with the American Civil War, which caused widespread separation of families, created a sudden increase in demand for photography. CDVs were introduced to America in 1860 and were at peak popularity from 1863 to 1878, gradually displaced by the larger cabinet card format to the point that CDVs had virtually disappeared by 1890.</p><p>During this period, a combination of changing photographic standards, styles of mounting cards, as well as changing styles of hair and clothing provide a powerful basis for dating CDVs. What follows are my attempts to identify and date the photographs, primarily relying on the volume <em>19th Century Card Photos KwikGuide</em>, Gary W. Clark, 2013, phototree.com (hereafter: KG). I will provide evidence that most, and perhaps all of the photos are from the early to mid 1860’s.</p><p>As each CDV is examined, keep the following features and their implications in mind:</p><ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Borders:</strong> “Nearly all pre-1863 cards have no border. Even though borders first appeared in 1862 (usually hand drawn) this style was not widely used until 1864. … The first commonly used borders usually consisted of two thin gilt lines of the same width. These have only been found on documented 1863 and 1864 cards. Beginning in 1864, nearly all documented cards, especially the vast number with tax stamps, have two gilt lines, but the outer line is considerably thicker that the inner line. This dual-width style of border remained almost unchanged until about 1869.” (KG, p18.) <em>The QPL portraits show examples of no border, single, and same-width double borders.</em></p></li><li>
<p><strong>Card Corners:</strong> “Early carte de visits had square cut corners. … Around 1870, along with the introduction of the thicker cards, the cards now had rounded corners.” (KG, p20.)</p></li><li>
<p><strong>Photographer’s Imprint:</strong> “The first imprints were very simple, one to three lines of text identifying the photographer or studio, and the address, most stamped by the photographer themselves. But when the mass produced, pre-cut cards from major manufacturers became available after 1863, the imprints gradually became more elaborate especially patriotic imprints…were very popular during the Civil War years.” (KG: p21.)</p></li><li>
<p><strong>Head Poses:</strong> “The head post was most popular in the early 1860’s, usually treated with a vignette look, with the area around the head feathered or gradually fading away. The image area in these head poses was quite small, due to camera and lens technology at that time. The camera was usually 12 or more feet from the subject, and the concept of telephoto or zoom did not exist.” (KG, p22.) <em>Most of the QPL portraits are head vignettes.</em></p></li><li>
<p><strong>Seated Poses:</strong> “Full seated poses were still frequently taken into the early 1870s. However, these poses tended to give way to close up portraits and mostly vanished by the mid 1870s. One exception was children.” (KG, p22.)</p></li><li>
<p><strong>Standing Poses:</strong> “Full length photos of people standing were very popular beginning in the early 1860’s, faded later in the decade, and became rare by the mid 1870s.” (KG, p22.) <em>These QPL portraits contain two standing photos, both of which have a same-width double border.</em></p></li><li>
<p><strong>Women’s Hairstyles:</strong> “Cartes de visite from the early 1860’s show many examples of pulled-back hair being the standard for women, though it was less taut than previous decades.” (KG, p25.) <em>Among the QPL portraits, all three women photographed had this hairstyle.</em></p></li></ul><p>To begin, two of the photographs are explicitly identified:</p><div class=cols>

Warren&rsquo;s above:</p><figure>
<blockquote>
...the first revenue stamps printed by the United States government were issued in the midst of the American Civil War, prompted by the urgent need to raise revenue to pay for the great costs it incurred. ... Among the more notable instances of tax stamp usage occurred in the photography trade. As the Civil War progressed, the demand for photographs of family members, soldiers going off to war and returning war heroes increased dramatically, but not without the notice from the Federal government who saw the advent as an opportunity to raise much needed revenue for the war. On August 1, 1864 the Internal Revenue department passed a 'photograph tax' requiring photographers to pay a tax on the sale of their photographs. By 1864 there were no 'photography tax' stamps issued, so other stamps were substituted, typically, the proprietary or playing card revenue stamps was used, usually affixed to the back of the photograph. Already burdened with high overhead costs and scarcity of materials because of the war, large photograph companies organized and petitioned Congress, complaining that they were shouldering too much of the tax burden placed on the public. After exactly two years their constant efforts resulted in the tax being repealed on August 1, 1866. Several other widely used products, such as cotton, tobacco and alcohol, were also charged a proprietary tax which appreciably contributed to the revenues generated.

<p>The tax was based on the selling price of the image. 2-cent tax for pictures costing less than 25 cents. &mldr;All stamps included a description designating what the stamp was originally intended for, though no photograph-specific stamps were produced, many different stamps were used. Such designations include &ldquo;Bank Check&rdquo;, &ldquo;Proprietary&rdquo;, &ldquo;Express&rdquo;, and other names; and stamps were produced in a variety of colors.

If that relationship is correct, then this would strongly indicate that this is Deborah Mills. Although I currently don&rsquo;t know the name or vital dates of George Love&rsquo;s wife, Laura Love&rsquo;s mother, and although George Love had several daughters whose vital dates are also currently unknown to me (listed below in his brief biography), Laura Love cannot be in the portraits as she died years before the existence of CDVs, and it seems unlikely on its face this this collection would contain portraits of James D. Warren&rsquo;s mother-in-law and sister-in-law compared to the likelihood of it being Deborah Mills and one of her daughters. Further consider the relative unlikelihood that this could be the mother of one of James D. Warren&rsquo;s sisters-in-law.</p><p>The older man is likely Deborah’s husband <a href=https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/78770560/william-mills>William Mills</a> (17 Nov 1792, Smithtown NY to 15 Aug 1867, Buffalo NY), but it could also be James D. Warren’s father <a href=https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/180634786/orsamus-warren>Orsamus Warren</a> (07 Jun 1800 to 16 Feb 1876), although I offer the following subjective opinons: the man’s apparent age seems closer to William’s at the time the photograph was likely taken, and further, I see no resemblance between James D. Warren (or James&rsquo; brother Horatio, shown further below) and this gentleman. Another possibility is George Love, who died in 1870 and so overlaps the likely timeframe of the CDVs. Again, I know very little about George Love, including his exact birthdate, although it was likely near the turn of the 19th century. These three men alone exhaust the most likely candidates from that generation.</p><div class=cols>

<p>By the spring of 1860, dozens of photographers in New York, Boston and Philadelphia were offering CDVs to their customers. Since an extensive network of photographers was already in place offering tintypes, ambrotypes, and even some daguerreotypes, the new CDV style spread easily. Not wanting to lose any market share, manufacturers of photographic equipment and accessories quickly embraced the new format. (KG, p15-16.)</p></blockquote><blockquote>

the fatality:</p><p>“This morning, at eight o&rsquo;clock, Daniel J. Baker, one of the owners of the Dardanelles claim accompanied by Bowers, Frazer and Shaw, entered a tunnel to inspect the works, preparatory to commencing operations Bowers had gone to the top of the work on the outside, and turned on the water, some two hundred inches; but observing that the shaft was “clogged” apparently by a sliding or caving in of the sides, he hastened down into the tunnel to warn the others of the impending danger. He had scarcely reached them, they being then within perhaps twenty feet of the overhanging mouth of the narrow shaft that contained hundred of tons of water, rock and earth, and which was, just then, by the force of gravitation, ready to burst through its confinement into the channel below, But a moment or two before Bowers had given the alarm, the party were almost immediately under the shaft removing a stump, or a cluster of roots, which had been washed down on Saturday. The one nearest the danger, Frazer, being then perhaps ten feet off, and Baker immediately behind him, hearing the crash coming, turned and said: “Baker, we are lost!’ and before they could turn around, the mass fell. Frazer grabbed an upright timber on the side of the tunnel, where he sustained himself from being washed away into the gulf of destruction which was yawning to receive them but a few feet off. Shaw and Bowers hastily retreated before death and destruction into a side drift, close at hand, while the rocks, earth and water was at least four feet in depth around the lower limbs of Frazer, whose only safety was to cling to his hold. The rush and fall lasted perhaps two minutes and when the persons who survived recovered from the shock, and realized the narrow escape from death which they had made, they found that poor Baker was missing! On the first rush or fall, he seems to have been picked up by the earth and water and carried into the perpendicular shaft of forty feet, down which he was dashed, amid the power and weight of many tons to a rocky tunnel of six hundred feet, through which his body was again carried, and then dashed from the mouth of a flume to another fall of fifty feet perpendicular height! Here his body lodged, but life was extinct, and the soul of the poor mortal had wafted its way into the presence of its Maker, His remains were brought to his residence near at hand, where his grief-stricken wife, and a large number of his friends, in sorrow and tears received them, and are preparing them for their long, last resting place. On examination, it was found that the head was almost entirely crushed, and one arm broken.”</p><p>Mr. Baker was a native of Riga, Wyoming county, New York, and aged 34 years. The funeral took place at Todd’s Valley, on Wednesday, and was attended by nearly one hundred Masons, (of which fraternity deceased was an honored member,) and two hundred other citizens.</p></blockquote><figcaption>

<strong>Gold Districts of California</strong><br>
<strong>FOREST HILL</strong>
</p><p><em>Location.</em> The Forest Hill district is in south-central Placer County in the general vicinity of the town of that name. This district is fairlv large in area and includes not only the "diggings" 'at Forest Hill but those at Bath to the east, Todd Valley and Dardanelles to the southwest, and Yankee Jims to the northwest. The district is principally a placer-mining one, although there have been some productive quartz mines. </p><p><em>History.</em> Gold was discovered here in 1850. By 1852 the area was highly productive. In that year the Jenny Lind mine was discovered, and hydraulic mining was introduced at Yankee Jims by Colonel McClure. The town was an important trading center in those days. By 1868 the mines in the vicinity of the town had yielded more than $10 million. Large-scale hydraulic mining continued until the early 1880s and drift mining until the early 1900s. There was appreciable activity in the district again in the 1930s and early 1940s, and a few mines, such as the Paragon and Three Queens, have been worked since. Forest Hill is now an important lumbering center. The total output of the district is estimated to be at least $25 million, and it may be considerably more. </p><p><em>Geology.</em> The main early Tertiary channel of the Middle Fork of the American River enters the district from Michigan Bluff on the east. At Bath it turns north and then west and southwest and continues southwest through Forest Hill. At the Dardanelles mine west of Forest Hill, the channel swings northwest to Yankee Jims and then north to the Iowa Hill district. An intervolcanic channel extends west-southwest from Baker Ranch to north of Forest Hill. Another intervolcanic channel extends south-southwest between the above and Yankee Jims. The older quartzitic gravels near bedrock are coarse and well cemented and have yielded the most gold. Much of the gravel is overlain by rhyolite and andesite. Bedrock is slate with some phyllite, schist, and serpentine. Some of the gold-quartz veins were rich, especially those that occur near serpentine. The veins are usually three to four feet thick and strike in a northwesterly direction. A number of small but rich pockets were found in the Three Queens mine, the principal lode mine in the district. </p><p><em>Mines.</em> Placer: Baker Divide; Baltimore; Big Spring $150,000; Dardanelles $2 million+; Excelsior; Florida; Georgia Hill, Yankee Jim and Smiths Point, together $5 million; Grey Eagle; Homestake; Independent, New Jersey and Jenny Lind, together $2,653,000; Mayflower $1 million; Maus; Paragon $2.65 million+; Peckham Hill and Todd Valley, together $5 million; Pond; San Francisco- Small Hope; Yankee Jims. Lode: Dry Hill, Eureka, Cons. International, Mitchell, Three Queens $100,000+. </p></blockquote><figcaption>

<blockquote>
<p>Unlike hardrock mining, which extracts veins of precious minerals from solid rock, placer mining is the practice of separating heavily eroded minerals like gold from sand or gravel. The word placer is thought to have come from Catalan and Spanish, meaning a shoal or sand bar. The word entered the American vocabulary during the 1848 California Gold Rush, and when gold was discovered in Alaska and the Canadian Klondike in the late 1890s, the gold-seekers who rushed northward brought with them various placer mining technologies. By far the simplest was the prospector’s pan that worked by swirling a combination of water and gravel or sand and allowing the lighter, rocky material to spill out. Relying on the fact that gold is heavier than sand and rock is the principle used in all placer mining operations. </p><p> The first challenge is to find a creek drainage that over the eons has carried gold dust, flakes, and nuggets downward to be deposited in layers of creek sediments. To do this, prospectors used pans to test the surface gravels or dug straight down to a point just above bedrock where placer gold tends to collect. They then tunneled horizontally to follow the richest ground. This approach is called drift mining (the horizontal tunnel is the drift). These shafts and tunnels were typically dug in winter so that frozen ground would not melt and collapse on the miners. Even so, the practice was arduous and dangerous. In the spring and summer, a defrosting pile of gold-rich gravel called paydirt could be processed using the placer miner’s friend: water. </p></blockquote><figcaption>

My knowledge of the Mills family history has always been a bit sketchy, and as far as I know there are no photos of them among my family’s possessions - except possibly a tintype portrait that belongs to my 99 year old aunt.

<p>The "Battle Cry of Freedom", also known as "Rally 'Round the Flag", is a song written in 1862 by American composer George Frederick Root (1820–1895) during the American Civil War. A patriotic song advocating the causes of Unionism and abolitionism, it became so popular that composer H. L. Schreiner and lyricist W. H. Barnes adapted it for the Confederacy.
<p>
</p>A modified Union version was used as the campaign song for the Lincoln-Johnson ticket in the 1864 presidential election, as well as in elections after the war, such as for Garfield in the 1880 U.S. presidential election. The song was so popular that the music publisher had 14 printing presses going at one time and still could not keep up with demand. It is estimated that over 700,000 copies of this song were put in circulation.

As will be shown below, Thomas&rsquo;s Buffalo Directory indicates Thomas Helme Mills lived in the family home at 111 Park Street in 1868, the year after his father William&rsquo;s death. Several John Mills are listed in the directories of the 1860s, although none can yet be confirmed as William&rsquo;s son.</p><p>These portraits as well as other information on the Buffalo Mills that are in the Queens collection were transferred there from The Buffalo History Museum in Buffalo NY.</p><figure>
<blockquote>
<p>If I recall correctly, the photo of the house in Buffalo was the only thing we retained from the Mills family collection. Everything else, photos and papers, was transferred to Queens.
<p>
</p>However, we do have other loose photos of individuals in A-Z order by surname. I checked and these are the only people named Mills:
<p>
</p><ul>
<li> John H. Mills, Company D, appears to be a Civil War soldier portrait.</li><li> Edward M. Mills, ca. 1915. He is a young man in this photo, so he is not the Edward Mills who died in 1908.</li><li> Robert Mills, ca. 1880, as an elderly man.</li></ul></blockquote><figcaption>

<p>The town of Newstead was established in 1823 as the "Town of Erie" from the eastern part of the town of Clarence. In 1831, the town's name was changed to "Newstead", reportedly on the advice of Abigail Fillmore, who was fond of the poetry of Lord Byron.

This James Harrison Mills, a real estate and loan broker of 446 Main St., Buffalo, N.Y., compiled an extensive pedigree of the Mills Family, and corresponded on the subject in the years 1893-1895 with Mr. Thomas Morton Paton Mills of New York City on that subject. His letters and pedigree outlines, of which this present compilation is a review and amplification, are in the possession of the latter's daughter, Mrs. Robert B.

He was a &ldquo;self-made man&rdquo; who came from humble beginnings, the son of a farmer and <strong>general store proprietor</strong> who was one of the pioneers of western New York. He was known as a man of exceptional honesty and integrity, as well as for his fairness even when dealing with his most ardent political rivals. He had many friendships and acquaintances, and his support and loyalty to his friends so endeared him to them, that even his political opponents spoke effusively about their sense of loss at his passing. He was known to be highly intelligent and plain spoken. Many noted that he seemed to have an unusually deep understanding of human psychology and behavior, which made him a natural political leader and business manager. It was said a number of times that he was a selfless man who always acted in service of his community. He was physically robust and vigorous to the point that it was noted by many people, adding to the shock of his sudden passing.</p><figure>
<blockquote>
One of the best and most valuable citizens Buffalo ever had was lost when at half-past eight o'clock last evening, at his residence on North street, JAMES D. WARREN died. He had lain for several weeks on a bed of extreme suffering, with life from day to day trembling in the balance—a report of slight improvement occasionally relieving the solicitude of the community, only to be quickly followed by the intelligence that the promise of the symptoms had proven fallacious—yet to those who saw him but a comparatively little while ago in apparently rugged health and with an intellect a tower of strength, his taking off must seem a sudden dispensation. In the city of his home MR. WARREN’s death will be universally mourned; and the mourning will extend far beyond its borders, for his acquaintance throughout the state, and indeed the nation, was large, his reputation being that of a sturdily honest, and to an extent self-made man who did important service in the councils of the party of his preference and would perhaps have received high political honors had his life been prolonged. Quick witted, with broad intellectual grasp, and the peculiar faculty for managing men, MR. WARREN was long a recognized power in the local political and business spheres. He loved Buffalo and was always ready with his support for what he conceived to be its best interests.

An analysis of the quality of JAMES D. WARREN reveals him a man of commanding influence—a leader of men—of signal sagacity and prudence and unswerving attachment to causes he espoused and men he favored. No man in the state wielded larger influence in his local political community than he. Among the republicans of Erie county his will was law, for years; but he was never known to abuse his power or to forfeit the trust reposed in him. In the factional disturbances of the party in this state Mr. WARREN was pronounced in his position, but he never thereby lost the respect even of those who felt constrained to differ with him, and the <em>Democrat and Chronicle</em>, rarely in accord with him during the troublous period indicated, takes pleasure in testifying to this. He was a frank opponent, as well as a staunch friend. He enjoyed the friendship of President Arthur and many eminent public men. In his bearing he was urbane. As a citizen he was public-spirited, and in the domestic circle, exceedingly beloved. Fortune smiled upon him, and he was liberal in his charities. It was his pleasure to help others, and many are the men occupying places of trust and honor who own them to his kindly offices. Few men in the state will be more sadly missed than JAMES D. WARREN.

For even when past three-score MR. WARREN was a walking picture of robust health, a model of manly comeliness and strength. Few men of years could compare with him in those respects, and none of his age looked younger. He was made on a large scale, and up to the last two months looked good for another score years or more. There is something inexpressably sad in the thought of this strong man cut down so quickly in what seemed to be the very pride of his strength and the utmost height of his usefulness.

<blockquote>
<p>
Elsewhere THE EXPRESS prints the particulars of his life. Here it is not intended to do more than to speak briefly of Mr. Warren's marked characteristics, as they struck one who was closely associated with him for fifteen years. The memory of those fifteen years of intimate friendship and perfect confidence is stronger and even fresher now, and will be more enduring, than the recollection of anything that has unpleasantly occurred between them in the nine years since.
</p><p>
Mr. Warren was eminently a man of business, with all of an upright business-man's keen regard for his commercial reputations. His financial credit was always higher than that of many men of double his wealth. It was his first concern. In business affairs he was prudent and discreet, and successful of course. He made few losses, and knew how to keep what he had gained. Those who think of him first as a politician, as so many will, mistake his leading trait. He was first of all a man of business. Circumstances not of his own choosing, made him a political leader, and for the last five years, hardly any Republican in the State of New-York wielded a greater influence than he easily exerted in shaping the party's action in its nominating conventions both local and national.
</p><p>
Yet, but ten years ago, it was difficult to persuade Mr. Warren to remain on the State Committee, and he had absolutely no political ambition. He cared nothing for political power or honor. Yet, within the last two or three years, he was a candidate for the highest honors and greatest leadership his party in this State could bestow. Such wonderful changes will a few years work in men and things! And yet he was peculiarly a man of common sense. Political ambition, if it was in him ever, was a plant of late growth and an exotic at that. If he sought office it was because other men sorely wanted him to have it.
</p><p>
Many friends who think they knew Mr. Warren pretty well will find it hard to believe all this of him. But it is the truth. He labored more zealously to promote other men's ambitions than his own. Left to his own devices he would lately have lived a life of ease, in the enjoyment of the wealth which he had acquired in honorable business pursuits. He was fond of home and simple surrounding. He was justly proud of his ownership of the <em>Buffalo Commercial Advertiser</em>, and the fine printing business and splendid building with which the time-honored title is identified. But he had no false pride of any kind. He felt himself the equal of most men, but was never lofty with the lowly. In his domestic relations his life was beyond reproach. He was devoted to wife and children and generous with those of his blood not so near or dear.
</p><p>
It has been thought of Mr. Warren and not altogether without reason, that he was fond of money. This brief sketch of his character may well be closed with a statement which proves that honor was dearer to him than money. Together with the present writer, as joint proprietor of the <em>Commercial</em>, the firm was once sued for libel with damages laid at a hundred thousand dollars. The evening before the case was to come of for trial, after many delays, the partner who had the greater moral responsibility for the trouble was informed by the plaintiff's distinguished counsel that if the <em>Commercial</em> would publish only a few lines, to the effect that upon documentary evidence submitted to its editor its proprietors had become convinced that the publication complained of was incorrect and unjust, the suit would be withdrawn. No apology was asked for. Upon the spur of the moment, without opportunity for consulting with Mr. Warren, the editor rejected the proposition. Evidence sufficient to convince him that, the plaintiff had been wronged could convince the jury, he said, and if the <em>Commercial</em> had done the plaintiff such a plain wrong as that, its proprietors ought to suffer for it and they were willing to pay the damages. Next morning, an hour or two before the case was called, Mr. Warren was informed of what his partner had done. "What would <em>you</em> have said?" asked the editor. "Just what you said!" answered Mr. Warren instantly. "But suppose they get a verdict, what then?" "Why then, by –, we’ll pay it!” said Mr. Warren, with an oath which had in it no flavor of impiety.
</p><p>
That was the spirit of a proud, brave man, and the story is told here and now with a sort of sad pleasure in the reminiscence. Mr. Warren surely did not love money too well in that case. He was loyal and steadfast in the hour of trial. And perhaps some of his many friends will be glad to be told, or reminded that the libel suit was tried most ably on both sides, and that the verdict was “For the Defendants.”

I think the disputes between Warren and Matthews that appear in print are pretty one-sided. I have never seen a harsh word about Matthews from James D. Warren’s pen (which is not to say none exists). By most accounts James was a conciliator. Certainly, his role in the Blaine presidential campaign indicates that he was. Its notable that Matthews’s post-mortem encomium puts such emphasis on business and politics and remains silent on editing and writing. The other very interesting episode in James D. Warren’s life is the role he played in the senatorial races that were put in play by the resignation of Conkling and Platt. I’ll be happy to share the material I have if you decide to pursue the matter.

G.”, died six years after his father, but in that time faithfully continued his father’s example, as a businessman, a political leader, and a loyal friend beloved by many. The Commercial continued to gain prominence under Orsamus’ leadership, and when he died both the quantity and the nature of the memorials closely mirrored his father’s.</p><p>The Commercial fittingly wrote Orsamus’ best biography:</p><figure>
<blockquote>
<p>
Orsamus George Warren was born in Clarence, Erie County, July 21st, 1846, and was the eldest son of the late James D. Warren and Laura Love, his first wife. Orsamus attended school at Clarence and at the age of ten years came to Buffalo and attended school here. He also spent a year at the Canandaigua Academy. At the age of 17 he went to Europe with the late James N. Matthews, and made an extended tour of the continent. He also spent several months in study at Paris.
</p><p>
On his return to Buffalo, in 1867, he entered the counting room of the COMMERCIAL ADVERTISER office as a bookkeeper, the firm at that time being Matthews & Warren. His connection with the establishment continued uninterrupted to the day of his death. When his father, the late James D. Warren, became sole proprietor, the son became his business manager and practical associate. James D. Warren died December 17th, 1886, and the firm of James D. Warren’s Sons was thereafter formed, composed of Orsamus G. and Wm. C. Warren, and thus continued to this day.
</p><p>
Mr. Warren was married October 22nd, 1875, to Elizabeth Griffin, daughter of the late John B. Griffin. Mrs. Warren survives, also four children, three daughters and one son—Gertrude, Helen, Elizabeth, and James D. Warren, Jr.
<p>
</p>Mr. Warren became the successor of his father in Republican political leadership. He was for several years a member of the State Committee, and a delegate to State Conventions. He was a delegate from this district to the National Republican Convention of 1888, and had recently been elected a delegate to the Convention of 1892.
</p><p>
He was for eight years a member of the Executive Committee of the State Associated Press, and served last year as President of the Association, retiring at the annual meeting held last month in New York.
</p><p>
Mr. Warren was identified With many large business interests, in addition to his proprietorship of the COMMERCIAL. He was vice-president of the Buffalo Natural Gas Fuel Company, a director of the American Exchange Bank, a trustee of the Buffalo Savings Bank, vice-president of the Depew Improvement Company, and a director of the Bellevue Land Company.
</p><p>
He was also a member of the Buffalo Club and of the Country Club. Mr. Warren had the reputation of being a far-seeing and remarkably sagacious man of business. In social life he was of a most amiable disposition, and the friends who knew and loved him know best, though they can hardly realize at present, what a loss they have sustained.
</p></blockquote><figcaption>

</figcaption></figure><p>As noted above, Orsamus was accompanied on his European trip by his father’s then business partner and eventual rival, James Matthews, whose son, <a href=https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/111297478/george-edward-matthews>George Edward Matthews</a> (17 Mar 1855 to 11 Jun 1911), was a close friend of Orsamus. George followed his father in the newspaper business just as Orsamus had his.</p><figure>
<blockquote>
<p>
The Buffalo Press Club held a meeting on Saturday to adopt resolutions of sympathy with the family of Mr. Warren.
</p><p>
George E. Matthews of the Express was the first speaker, and he said it was hard for him to speak about Mr. Warren, for they had been friends from boyhood, and in many respects Mr. Warren had acted as his elder brother.
</p><p>
“Certainly,” said he, “no one could have been kinder or more helpful than he was to me. When we became men our affairs in life were separate, but I do not think that either of us ever forgot our old friendship and personally our friendship was always of the sincerest kind.

<p>
Three or four years before his father’s death he became practically the manager of the concern. The senior Warren still visited the office and gave a general direction to affairs, but to his eldest son he committed all the details and executive work, giving him also an interest in the business. The two sons became the sole owners of the newspaper and printing house on the death of their father.
</p><p>
O. G. Warren was an excellent business man. He received a thorough education in the counting room from his father. He was systematic and had aptitude, discernment and good judgment. He was a director of the American Exchange Bank, and last year was president of the New York Associated Press.
</p><p>
…Though Mr. Warren never held office, and never sought one, he was active in politics and influential in getting places for his friends. He succeeded his father as member of the State Committee from this district and held the place until last fall, when he declined to serve longer, and in his place John N. Scatcherd was elected. Mr. Warren was a delegate to every State convention since his father’s death. While he was on the State Committee he was a member of the Executive Committee. He was a delegate to the National convention of 1888, and a delegate-elect to the convention which is to meet June 7 at Minneapolis.
</p><p>
He was fond of society and had many warm friends, not only in this city but also throughout the State.

<p>
Whatever he did was done thoroughly; always alert, enterprising and straightforward. In every relation of life Mr. Warren won and held the friendship and confidence of the men with whom he came into contact. He was always sincere, true to his convictions, and steadfast in the purposes to which his judgment committed him. Mr. Warren, at the death of his honored father, was placed in a most critical position as the director of a great newspaper property and the undisputed leader of the republican party. How well he executed the trusts confided to him we ail know.
</p><p>
It is not always an advantage to be the son of a distinguished father. It is common for the merits of the son to suffer injustice by comparison, but our friend was a man of uncommon intensity of purpose; his individuality was so strong that he needed no reflected light to make him a leader of men and a sagacious business man.

These three references to his recent movements hint at the things he was, the things he loved, the things he did in life—outside of his home. First he was a newspaperman. He came up to that estate by his father’s side—by the side of a rare father, for such was James D. Warren—who inducted his son successively into journalism of an admirable sort, then into politics, and transferred to him at death the mantle of undisputed leadership in the County of Erie, and concurrently placed upon his shoulders and in his hands the responsibilities and substance of accumulated wealth and the open opportunities of enhancing it. The years can be counted on one’s fingers since the most of this came to O. G. Warren. He pushed on the newspaper, the BUFFALO COMMERCIAL to increased deserving in public estimation; he held the attachment of the party as his father had done; and he was singularly fortunate in investments coupled to Buffalo’s growth and the promotion of it, so that he lays down a fortune larger than that which fell to his brother and himself at a date comparatively recent.

The Warren and Mills family stayed close together. Both James D. Warren and his son William C. Warren lived in houses on North Street very close to its intersection with Park Street, where the Mills houses are located. James D. Warren’s house is known to us only from photographs (see attached), but The William C. Warren House is extant. Also, the vandalized headstone of James Warren (James D. Warren’s grandfather) that I mentioned is located on Allegany Road as it passes through Darien (just a few miles south of Corfu), a picture of that is in “Southern Pilgrimage.” I wish I had some way to confirm that the William and Deborah Mills are the sitters in the first two carte de visite portraits. …It is unlikely anyone in the family will recognize the portraits, but I will check around. The lack of correspondence between the list of William and Deborah’s children in the 1850 census and the published genealogy is curious.

<p>
WILLIAM C. WARREN, editor and publisher of the Buffalo Commercial, is one of the foremost newspaper men of Western New York, a leading Republican and a citizen prominent in the business, political and social life of Buffalo. Mr. Warren is in the prime of years and vigor and is probably the youngest of Buffalo's newspaper proprietors. His ability as a journalist may be characterized as a natural result of inheritance and environment. The name of Warren is one of the oldest in the history of Buffalo newspaper enterprise, and the subject of this sketch was brought up in an atmosphere of journalism and became familiarized in early life with the duties of editor and publisher. In both capacities he has won decisive success, and his newspaper pursuits have run parallel with a current of equally notable activities in politics and public affairs.
<p>
</p>Mr. Warren was born in Buffalo on the 4th of August, 1859, and has always made the Queen City his home. His father was James D. Warren, for many years editor and proprietor of the Commercial Advertiser. William C. Warren received his early education in the Buffalo public schools, attended Briggs Classical School, and graduated from the scientific department of Yale University in 1880. He then became associated in the management of the Commercial Advertiser, which after the death of the senior Warren in 1886 was continued by his sons under the firm style of James D. Warren's Sons. In 1890 the word "Advertiser" was dropped and the paper has since been known as the Commercial. Since the death of Orsamus G. Warren, William C. Warren has been managing proprietor.
<p>
</p>As an editor and publisher, Mr. Warren is the vigorous, modern type of newspaper man. He has maintained the sterling traditions of his paper and has given it the distinctive impress of his personality. The staunch Republicanism of the Commercial Advertiser is perpetuated and emphasized in its successor, the Commercial, which has for many years been the representative newspaper of its party in this section of the State. Viewed as to its general policy the Commercial is characterized by progressiveness tempered by sound conservatism. The public spirit of its proprietor is reflected in his paper whose championship of the interests of Buffalo and Erie County is zealous, efficient, and unswerving in its constancy. The influence of the Commercial in politics has long been one of the important and well recognized factors of existing conditions. A man of clear-cut views and definite political convictions, the editorial opinions of Mr. Warren carry the weight which attaches to utterances which deal frankly with issues and are founded on experience and practical knowledge.
<p>
</p>From the beginning of his active career Mr. Warren has been a leading figure in Republican politics. For many years he was the adviser and political associate of John R. Hazel, then the recognized leader of the Republican party in Erie County. Prior to 1898 Mr. Warren, though wielding a large influence, had not held an official position in the party organization, and he has never at any time been a candidate for public office. In the Republican State Convention, held at Saratoga in 1898, the delegates from the 33d Congressional District elected him to succeed James A. Roberts as State Committeeman, and he continued to serve in that capacity for eight years, winning a high reputation for tact and sagacity as a party manager. When John R. Hazel was elevated to the Federal Bench in 1900, Mr. Warren was chosen as the man best fitted to be his successor as the Republican leader of Erie County.
<p>
</p>In addition to his newspaper and printing business Mr. Warren is interested in the Buffalo General Electric Co., of which he is a Director. He is a member of the Saturn and Country clubs of Buffalo, and the University Club of New York City.
<p>
</p>On April 2, 1891, Mr. Warren married Miss Clara Davock, daughter of John Davock of Buffalo.

C. WARREN DIES IN HOME</strong></p><p><strong>Ex-Buffalo Publisher Was Leader in G.O.P. Affairs.</strong></p><p>William C. Warren, 76, former Buffalo newspaper publisher and prominent figure in political affairs for many years, died at 4 o&rsquo;clock this morning in his residence, 173 North street.</p><p>Of sturdy physique, Mr. Warren had been in excellent health until three days ago. Saturday, in fact, he had walked downtown. Sunday he contracted a cold, old age complications set in, then death followed.</p><p>The funeral will be held Saturday afternoon at 2:30 o&rsquo;clock in the home, Burial will be in Forest Lawn cemetery. Dr, Ralph B. Hindman, pastor of First Presbyterian church, will officiate.</p><p>Mr. Warren, on graduation from college in 1880, started his newspaper career on the Buffalo Commercial, which his father owned. In 1894 he became its publisher and continued until 1918, when he
retired. The Commercial has since gone out of existence.</p><p><strong>Held Three Posts.</strong></p><p>An outstanding Republican, Mr. Warren reached the zenith of his political life around the turn of the century, He served as state committeeman, as county chairman, and as delegate to the national conventions in 1900 and 1904.</p><p>Back in the days when Benjamin B. Odell was running New York state in his capacity as governor, and also running the Republican portion thereof as chairman of the party&rsquo;s state committee, Mr. Warren loomed large on the political horizon, not only in Buffalo, but throughout the state.</p><p>Clark H. Timmerman was chairman of the Erie county Republican committee and Henry Seilheimer was secretary, having just been made son on the advancement of the late George D. Emerson, long-time secretary, to the newly created position of commissioner of elections, but Mr. Warren was leader and recognized as such at home and abroad.</p><p><strong>Post Was Important.</strong></p><p>The only political post he held was state committeeman, this being for the old West side Congressional district so long represented by the late Col. D. S. Alexander, but in those days a state committeeman, representing as he did a Congressional district instead of half an Assembly district, as is the case under the present law, was of distinct size in his community and outside of it.</p><p>Others on the state committee at that time were such political giants of their day as the late William Barnes Jr. of Albany, the late George W. Aldridge of Rochester, the late Francis Hendricks of Syracuse, the late J. Sloat Fassett of Elmira, the late George W. Dunn of Binghamton and last of the Old Guard to go, the late William L. Ward who dominated Westchester county for well over a quarter of a century.</p><p><strong>Son of G. O. P. Leader.</strong></p><p>Towering over all of them, however, stood Gov. Odell, who had recently unhorsed the venerable Thomas C. Platt as state leader and was functioning as such in the dual role of governor-chairman, a role which drew some criticism, of course, but not sufficient in volume to seriously ruffle that militant partisan.</p><p>Mr. Warren came rather naturally into his leadership. He was the son of James D. Warren, in his day one of the leaders in the Republican party in New York state, pal of Platt&rsquo;s, one-time chairman of the state committee and a delegate to one or two national conventions, besides bossing the party locally in the days when Grover Cleveland and his political intimates were giving the Republicans some worthwhile opposition.</p><p>James D. Warren passed on and his mantle fell on the shoulders of his son, the late Orsamus G. Warren, elder brother of William C. Warren.</p><p><strong>Hazel Takes Reins.</strong></p><p>On the death of &ldquo;O. G.,&rdquo; as he was known, John R. Hazel took over the Republican machine and ran it most efficiently until made a federal judge by President McKinley.</p><p>When he ascended the bench for the Wester district of New York, from which he only recently stepped down on attaining the age limit, he turned the Republican machine over to William C. Warren, who entered upon a leadership in which he held sway in spite of opposition both within and without the party until he, like Gov. Odell, his chief, was eventually toppled from power.</p><p>In those days Mr. Warren was the directing force on the old Buffalo Commercial, started by his father with his nephew, the present James D. Warren and other aides, including William C. Foster, managing editor; Frank M. Hollister and Arthur Austin, associate editors; A. E. Richmond, city editor, all since passed on.</p><p><strong>Faced Much Strife.</strong></p><p>From a little back office on the first floor of the Commercial building Mr. Warren was wont to issue orders which were obeyed in the matter of county and municipal nominations.</p><p>Working with him as state committeeman for the old East side Congressional district, represented at Washington by William H. Ryan, was John Grimm, aided by the late Simon Seibert and sundry other lieutenants, most of them now deceased.</p><p>Not that Mr. Warren, even at the height of his power, held unquestioned sway over his political domain. Few leaders do. Mr. Warren faced strife aplenty within the Republican ranks. The late Fred Greiner, then postmaster, was restive under his rule. The late Edward H. Butler generally found himself out of step and so did the late George E. Mathews, aligning the Evening News and the Express together against the Commercial on more than one battlefront.</p><p><strong>Machine Beaten.</strong></p><p>Finally, in the Summer of 1905, the long anticipated break came in the open. A combination of state chieftains lined up behind Gov. Frank W. Higgins, with former Gov. Odell as their objective. Odell leaders faced a fight for control throughout the state. Here in Erie county Mr. Greiner stepped out in front with the late John G. Wickser as his candidate for state committeeman.</p><p>In the alignment that marked that memorable battle County Chairman Timmerman threw in his political fortunes with Mr. Greiner. So did John Grimm. So did Simon Seibert. The Evening News was hurled into the center of the fray by Mr. Butler. Under the weight of this onslaught the Warren machine went down to defeat.</p><p><strong>Odell Man Loses.</strong></p><p>So, on the larger state stage, did the Odell machine, At the opening of the next session of the Legislature in 1906, the Odell candidate for speaker of the Assembly, the late Edwin A. Merritt of St. Lawrence county, was beaten by a young, second-year member from Livingston county, James W. Wadsworth by name, whom Gov. Higgins and the newly-enthroned state leaders had picked as their candidate. Oddly enough, except that nothing is so very odd in politics they had the support of President Theodore Roosevelt, despite the fact that the strenuous &ldquo;T. R.&rdquo; had only recently incited rebellion in the Livingston - Niagara - Orleans - Genesee - Wyoming Congressional district against the elder Wadsworth and driven him from Congress after many years of distinguished service.</p><p><strong>Drops Active Politics.</strong></p><p>Following his defeat, Mr. Warren dropped out of active politics. It wasn&rsquo;t so many years afterward that he sold the Commercial, which a brace of new owners wrecked in short order. Thereafter he devoted himself to looking after his property which a shrewd eye for business had amassed during his busy career. So completely did he withdraw from the political game that when, two years ago, he appeared at Elmwood Music hall to hear Representative Wadsworth on the occasion his speech there, veterans present had to rub their eyes and take a second look.</p><p>Mr. Warren was a high type of political boss who played the game according to the rules which governed it in his day, rules which included no direct primaries and no women&rsquo;s suffrage, both presenting perplexing complications to his successors. He had devoted followers and, like all political leaders, he faced and battled with bitter enemies. In the midst of the hottest political battle he ever remained the gentleman. And his word, once passed, was not to be questioned or doubted.</p><p><strong>Was Buffalo Native.</strong></p><p>Born in this city Aug. 4, 1859, Mr. Warren came of old Buffalo stock. His grandparents, Orsamus and Nancy Joslyn Warren, were Buffalonians. His father, James D. Warren, operated the old Buffalo Commercial Advertiser and founded the Commercial. His mother was Mary Mills Warren.</p><p>William C. Warren received his education in the public schools, Briggs Classical school and Yale college. He was graduated from Yale with the degree of bachelor of philosophy.</p><p>After he retired from the Commercial, Mr. Warren had no specific business connections except a directorship of the Buffalo, Niagara & Eastern Power company.</p><p>Surviving are his wife, Mrs. Clara S. Wright Warren; two sons, William C. Warren Jr., Buffalo, and John D. Warren, New York; and a daughter, Mrs. Edward Streeter, New York.</p><p>Mr. Warren was a member of the First Presbyterian church. He belonged also to the Buffalo Country club, University and Yale clubs of New York, and Graduate club of New Haven.</p></blockquote><figcaption>

<p>
JAMES D. WARREN was a representative figure in Buffalo journalism. As editor and proprietor of the Buffalo Commercial Advertiser, now the Commercial, Mr. Warren was widely known in the newspaper world and he was equally prominent in public life.
<p>
</p>Mr. Warren was born in Bennington, Wyoming County, N.Y., January 19th, 1823. His father, Orsamus Warren, was a farmer and one of the pioneers of Western New York. From Bennington the family removed to Wales, Erie County, and later to Clarence, where Orsamus Warren bought a farm and carried on a store. When his father came to Erie County James D Warren was about two years old. As a boy he attended school, worked on the farm and assisted his father in his business. When twenty years old he made a tour of the South, spending a year in Natchez, Miss. Returning North, for a number of years he engaged in mercantile and farming pursuits in Clarence. Meantime he became active in politics and served several terms as Supervisor. In 1854 he was elected County Treasurer for a term of three years. Subsequently he held for two or three terms the office of Clerk of the Board of Supervisors.
<p>
</p>In 1861 Mr. Warren began his life work as editor and publisher. In April of that year, with Rufus Wheeler and Joseph Candee, he became joint purchaser of the Buffalo Commercial Advertiser, with which newspaper he continued to be identified till his death. The history of this paper began in 1811, when it was founded as the Buffalo Gazette. It passed into the hands of a succession of owners, from a weekly became a daily, and was issued as the Daily Commercial Advertiser on the 1st of January, 1835. In May, 1839, the Buffalo Journal was merged with the Commercial Advertiser. In 1862 Mr. Candee withdrew from the business, his interest being purchased by Messrs. Warren and Wheeler. Immediately afterward Mr. James N. Matthews was admitted to partnership, the firm becoming Wheeler, Matthews & Warren. Two years, later Mr. Wheeler retired and the firm was styled Matthews & Warren. In 1877 Mr. Warren purchased the interest of Mr. Matthews and from that time was the sole proprietor and publisher of the Commercial Advertiser. Under his management the paper became the leading Republican newspaper of Western New York. As an editor Mr. Warren won and retained a distinctive place as a stalwart exponent of Republican principles and as a broad minded representative of the best interests of the community. His conception of journalism was high and he maintained his ideals with unfaltering constancy. Originally in Main street, the plant of the Commercial Advertiser was removed in 1868 to the Adams Block in Washington street. In September of the same year the building was destroyed by fire. It was promptly rebuilt and the establishment continued to occupy it till April 10, 1882, when the business was removed to its present new building at Washington and North Division streets.
<p>
</p>In addition to his newspaper interests, Mr. Warren was President of White's Bank, then one of the well known financial institutions of Buffalo.
<p>
</p>Mr. Warren had an active share in Republican party management, was Chairman and for many years a member of the State Committee, and on numerous occasions served as a delegate to State and national conventions. He was what was known as a stalwart Republican, and was the recognized leader of that branch of the party in Western New York.
<p>
</p>Mr. Warren was married twice. His first wife, to whom he was married October 31, 1845, was Miss Laura Love, daughter of George Love of Buffalo. She died in 1849, leaving one son, Orsamus G. Warren. In 1851 Mr. Warren married for his second wife Miss Mary Mills, daughter of Judge Mills of Clarence, N. Y. The children of this union were one son William C. Warren and two daughters, Miss Kate and Miss Mary Warren of Buffalo.
<p>
</p>The death of James D. Warren occurred on the 16th of December, 1885.

The Stalwarts were a faction of the Republican Party that existed briefly in the United States during as well as after Reconstruction and the Gilded Age during the 1870s and 1880s. Led by U.S. Senator Roscoe Conkling—also known as "Lord Roscoe"—Stalwarts were sometimes called Conklingites. ... Stalwarts were the "traditional," "Old Guard" Republicans who advocated for the civil rights of African-Americans and opposed Rutherford B. Hayes's efforts to enact civil service reform. They were pitted against the "Half-Breeds" (classically liberal moderates) for control of the Republican Party. The most prominent issue between Stalwarts and Half-Breeds was patronage. The Half-Breeds worked to enact moderate civil service reform, and finally helped pass the Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act. This was signed by Arthur, who became President after the assassination of James A. Garfield, a Half-Breed. Stalwarts favored traditional machine politics.

WARREN,</p><p>Proprietor of the Buffalo Commercial Advertiser,</p><p>Died Friday Evening, Dec. 17, 1886.</p><p>James D. Warren, proprietor of the <em>Commercial Advertiser</em>, died quite unexpectedly at half past eight o&rsquo;clock last evening, at his home on North Street. Though he was known to be seriously ill, no one seems to have been aware of his critical condition until within a few hours of the end. His physicians predicted his recovery only a day or two ago. Though it was known that he did not take this hopeful view of his condition, and it was also known that he had hardly more than an even chance with his disease, it was late yesterday afternoon before any one saw that the end was near.</p><p>The disease which terminated fatally made its appearance early in October, and during that month he visited New York to confer with the State Committee, going as a member by proxy. While in. New York Mr. Warren visited, among other friends, ex-President Arthur, finding the latter out of health, and leaving him with a sentiment of deep sadness, feeling and saying that he should never see him again. He came home quite unwell, His trip had failed to do for him what his friends had hoped. He was threatened with local inflammatory troubles of hereditary character and was quite nervous about his condition. From the first he was quite discouraged. His father had died of the same disease, and he believed he was about to follow him. But be struggled against the attack and went to the office for some time. Towards the last of October he was advised by his physician, Dr. J. D, Hill, to stay at home and submit to severe treatment for his disease. He was then threatened with acute inflammation of the bladder, and was obliged to remain at home.</p><p>For a time the disorder appeared to yield to treatment. Mr. Warren arose every day and his friends went to see him. On Election Day they urged him to go out and vote and he was driven to the polls. This was the last day he went out, though he was not materially worse for several days. His physician predicted that if he was patient he would come around all right. But he was not hopeful, and would often say that he had to go. On the Friday before Thanksgiving he felt better than for Several days before, and talked about getting well. On the next day unfavorable symptoms set in and Dr. Burwell was called in for counsel. The Doctor said that while alarming symptoms were present they were not necessarily fatal. Here was a staunch ship, to use Dr, Burwell’s words, that had been sailing over 60 years. The ship had got on the rocks, but he trusted they could float her.</p><p>It was but an even chance, however, after that, and complications appeared during the last three weeks of his life that greatly discouraged his doctors. Precisely what the final ailment was will be revealed only by the autopsy which, on the request of the physicians, is to be held. About ten days ago a swelling appeared on the inner side of his left thigh near the groin. It was at first thought to be merely sympathetic with his bladder trouble, but it did not disappear, and on Dr. Hill&rsquo;s becoming ill, Dr. Roswell Park was called, who, with Dr, Burwell, concluded to open the swelling, on the supposition of its being an abscess. This was done yesterday, the patient appearing to suffer but little from the operation. The doctors predicted that he would improve, but an hour later he suffered a severe chill, followed by a high fever. His temperature rose to 105 and his pulse to 140, and he soon became unconscious, from which state he never rallied, At 4 P. M. his physicians gave up hope, and at 6 they said he must go almost immediately. His iron constitution, however, prolonged life until 8.30, when he passed away without a struggle.</p><p>By his first wife Mr. Warren had one child, Mr. Orsamus G. Warren. Mr. William C. Warren and Mrs. Isaac H. Bromley, Jr., are offspring of the second union.</p><p>EXPRESSIONS OF SORROW.</p><p>Prominent Men Who Knew Mr. Warren Intimately Talk Feelingly about Him.</p><p>Towards the close of the meeting of the General Committee on Charter Revision at the Mayor&rsquo;s office last evening, the news of James D. Warren&rsquo;s death was received by telephone. It was announced very feelingly by Mr. James C. Fullerton, and created profound regret.</p><p>In moving the appointment of a committee of three to draft suitable resolutions, Mr. Fullerton said it was unnecessary for him to say anything in eulogy of a man who commanded so deeply the respect and sympathy of such a body as that present, who knew and appreciated the merits of Mr. Warren as a citizen, and his great services to the community as a public man. He had always placed uppermost in his breast the dictates of duty.</p><p>The motion that the chairman appoint a committee of three to draft suitable resolutions to be presented at the next meeting was seconded by Mayor Becker. The chair appointed Mr. James C. Fullerton, Mr. George Gorham, and Gen. John C. Graves as such committee.</p><p>A Banking Friend.</p><p>Gen. Rufus L. Howard, who was called upon at a late hour last night, said that be had been very much surprised at the news of Mr. Warren&rsquo;s death.</p><p>Gen. Howard said he hardly felt able that evening to say much with respect to Mr. Warren&rsquo;s life or his personal knowledge of him as a friend. &ldquo;I have known him,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;ever since I came to Buffalo, and have always entertained for him a warm regard. He was a clear-headed, shrewd business man, and in all his business relations, as far as I am enabled to say, was perfectly upright and a pleasant man to meet.</p><p>&ldquo;My business relations with him have been closer since I became Vice-President of the White&rsquo;s Bank. Since his sickness I have taken more or less charge of the bank&rsquo;s affairs and to-morrow I shall call a meeting of the directors, as of course the bank cannot be closed immediately.&rdquo;</p><p>A Democratic Friend.</p><p>Judge James M. Humphrey, who has known Mr. Warren 35 years, said of him as his own home last night: &ldquo;He was a remarkably good business-man in every department of business. He was an honest, upright man. He was a profound judge of men–of human nature. He had largely the elements and characteristics that made him a leader among men, in politics especially. He was a strong partisan, yet not so strong as to do injustice to the motives of those opposed to him. He had a strong, decided, and positive convictions, and followed them out with both determination and sagacity. I think him to have been one of the leading men whose opinions and judgment were as highly regarded in the State as any man in his party occupying a private position. He exercised a controlling — a very controlling interest in the political action of his party in this County and had done so for a good many years. Mr. Warren was, moreover, a man of fine social qualities, and genial nature. He appreciated his friends and was true to them. His death will be a great loss to the business community and to his party.&rdquo;</p><p>A Business Friend.</p><p>Alfred P. Wright, an old friend of Mr. Warren, was grieved to learn of his death. &ldquo;Personally,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I feel that I have lost a very dear friend. I have known him for a great many years intimately. I have always been associated with him in politics, with the exception of one year, when we differed, but that did not interfere with our personal friendship. He was a strong, sterling, upright man. Occupying the position he did, he could not help making some political mistakes and some political enemies.</p><p>&ldquo;His integrity was above suspicion. He was very strong in his friendships, and had the faculty of holding the friends he made. He was the most lovable man to his family that you can possibly imagine. I feel that the city of Buffalo has lost one of its best men, whose place it will be hard to fill—one who has battled for years for Buffalo and its interests.&rdquo;</p><p>A Political Friend.</p><p>The Hon. Benjamin H. Williams got the News of Mr. Warren’s death from a reporter for THE EXPRESS. Said he:</p><p>“I feel his death is a great personal loss to me on the score of friendship. I had a very high opinion of Mr. Warren as a citizen, and as a man I had a great esteem for him. I regard his death as a great loss, not only to his family but to his immediate friends, the community, and I might also say to the State.”</p><p>A Boyhood Friend.</p><p>The Hon. Nelson K. Hopkins was deeply grieved when he learned the sad news. “I believe I have been acquainted with Mr. Warren longer than any other man in the city,” said Mr. Hopkins, “having become acquainted with him during his early boyhood. He was, during the early part of his life, a steady, faithful, and industrious young man. When I first knew him he was a clerk in his father’s store in Clarence Hollow. Since he has been a resident of Buffalo, he character has been almost too well known to the public for me to dwell on it. He has always occupied a high and honorable position.</p><p>“We have always belonged to the same party. He has achieved a reputation as a citizen and in his party as a gentleman that is not excelled by any other man. He has always been a man of very high character and undoubted integrity. His loss will be greatly felt throughout the entire community.”</p><p>The news of Mr. Warren’s death was known down town soon after the sad event occurred, and from all sides were heard expressions of sincere regret. Many old friend of the deceased whom reporters for THE EXPRESS called on last night had either retired or were so overcome at the reception of the sad news that they felt unable to make at that time any adequate expression of their feelings.</p><p>IN CHRONOLOGICAL ORDER.</p><p>The formal facts of James D. Warren’s Long and Many-Sided Career.</p><p>From Smith’s “History of the City of Buffalo and Erie County.”</p><p>James D. Warren was born in the town of Bennington, Wyoming, N. Y., on the 19th of January, 1823. His father, the late Orsamus Warren, was a farmer and one of the pioneers of Wester New York. After a brief residence in Bennington he moved to the town of Wales, Erie County, and from thence shortly afterwards to the town of Clarence, Erie County, where he purchased and settled upon a farm situated about a mile from the village. He also carried on a country store at Clarence, dealing in a general assortment of dry-goods, groceries, and farmer’s implements.</p><p>When the family moved to Clarence the subject of this notice was about two years old. He attended school, wrought upon the farm and assisted his father in the management of the village store. Before attaining his majority Mr. Warren made a tour of the South, spending about a year in Natchez, Miss. Returning North, he engaged in business in Clarence, following mercantile and farming pursuits, and was elected a Supervisor for several terms from that town. In 1854, at the age of 31, Mr. Warren was elected County Treasurer, and served a term of three years. He subsequently held the office of Clerk of the Board of Supervisors for two or three, terms, and in April, 1861, in connection with Joseph Wheeler and Joseph Candee, he purchased the Commercial Advertiser newspaper, and entered upon his life-work,—that of publisher.</p><p>In 1863 Messrs. Wheeler and Warren purchased Mr. Candee’s interest, and immediately after Mr. James N. Matthews was admitted into the firm. Mr. Wheeler retired from business some two years afterwards, and the firm then became Matthews & Warren. In 1877 Mr. Warren purchased the interest of his partner in the <em>Commercial Advertiser,</em> and has since that time been its sole proprietor and publisher.</p><p>He is an earnest and active Republican, and has been prominently identified with that party since its organization. The only offices he has held, as above stated, are Supervisor, Erie County Treasurer, and Clerk of the Board of Supervisors. He has been active and influential in the direction and management of party affairs, serving repeatedly as a member of the State Central Committee, as well as a delegate to the State and National nominating conventions. He is what is known as a Stalwart Republican, and is the recognized leader of that branch of the party in Erie County, if not in Western New York. His sound good sense, thorough knowledge of human nature, keen observation, valuable experience in affairs, and genial disposition combine to make him not only a successful man in business, but a far-seeing politician as well. Under his direction and management the <em>Commercial Advertiser</em> has become the leading Republican newspaper of Western New York.</p><p>He is also president of White&rsquo;s Bank, one of the oldest and most substantial financial institutions in Buffalo. Mr. Warren has been twice married—first to Miss Laura Love, daughter of the late George Love, by whom he had one son. After her death he married Miss Mary Mills, daughter of the late Judge Mils of Clarence, by whom he has had one son and two daughters.</p><p>THE DEAD POLITICIAN.</p><p>What He Did and also What He Was Both in State and National Affairs.</p><p>The following sketch of the dead leader’s career in State and National politics is based on material furnished by some of the gentlemen connected with the <em>Commercial Advertiser</em> who shared Mr. Warren’s political activity.</p><p>Mr. Warren, Mr. Arthur, Mr. Conkling, and Alonzo B. Cornell were the delegates-at-large from New York State to the Republican National Convention in Chicago in 1880. Mr. Warren was one of the leaders in the movement which culminated in the 206 convention votes for Grant. In 1884 he was again a delegate to the Republican National Convention also at Chicago, this time representing his district. At this convention he was the recognized leader of the Arthur forces, and mad a hard fight against Mr. Blaine. On the latter’s nomination Mr. Warren gave him support through his journal, the <em>Buffalo Commercial Advertiser,</em> and as the chairman of the Republican Central Committee of New York State.</p><p>He was a delegate to every State Convention of his party in New York held since 1872. That was the memorable year in the political management of the State. Mr. Greeley’s candidacy as an independent was a disturbing influence in the Republican party. Up to that time the State machinery had been controlled by Gen. Fenton and his forces, but now it passed into the hands of Senator Conkling and his supporters. From 1872 to 1882 they held the undisturbed control of the party organization.</p><p>As a member of the State Central Committee during these years Mr. Warren did eminent work for the party organization. In 1883 he became Chairman of the Committee. That was the year succeeding the Cleveland cyclone, which gave the head of the Democratic ticket 192,000 majority. It was under Mr. Warren’s management that the State was reclaimed to the Republicans by the election of the head of their ticket—Gen. Carr, for Secretary of State—while the Democratic majority for the remainder of the ticket was cut down to the merest margin.</p><p>It was at Mr. Blaine’s request that he became chairman of the committee in 1884. Mr. Warren strongly opposed some of the steps of the closing days of that campaign, to which the defeat of Mr. Blaine is commonly attributed. He was opposed to the Delmonico dinner, and counseled against the ministers’ meeting at which the Rev. Dr. Burchard made use of his ill-advised phrase, “Rum, Romanism, and Rebellion.” It was Mr. Warren’s advice that if the meeting be held at all the speakers first write out what they intended to say and submit the manuscript to the party managers; but the National Committee looked upon this as a needless precaution and the advice was disregarded.</p><p>Throughout the campaign of 1884 Mr. Warren gave unflagging personal attention to the work. For nearly three months he remained in News York City, almost constantly devoted to the labor of the Committee. The strain was so terrible that he barely escaped prostration, and for this reason firmly declined to go on the Committee again.</p><p>Mr. Warren was prominently mentioned as a candidate for United States Senator when Mr. Evarts was elected, and was a candidate for Governor in the convention of 1885, receiving 138 votes. His name has also been mentioned in connection with the Senatorial election this year.</p></blockquote><figcaption>

WARREN.</p><p>After five weeks of suspense—weeks in which hope has alternated with fear, confidence has been frequently stimulated to give place to anxiety, and the suggestion of probability has been strengthened only to yield to the reality of despair, the members of the COMMERCIAL staff gathered at the house of affliction waiting to hear it, bur dreading to hear it, were told in few words that &ldquo;all is over Mr. WARREN has passed away.”</p><p>It is not in this hour of deep affliction, not at this time when the blow of bereavement has fallen, that those most deeply afflicted can realize the extent of their loss, or can find words to let others know what the loss has been. Others today are telling what this community has lost by the death of Mr. WARREN: others are recounting his service to this public, to this party, to the cause of honorable journalism, and in the ranks of the upright, manly citizenship. Through these columns those who have been associated with JAMES D. WARREN for many years testify only of his steadfastness, his unselfishness, his sincerity as a friend. We all know that Mr. WARREN never attempted, never desired to impress those with whom he was most closely identified in business relations with his importance or his influence as an employer; to be regarded as their friend, as their associate, their adviser and their guide, was his ambition. Not a man connected with this establishment, not one identified with this newspaper, could today recall one unkind word, one harsh word, and certainly not one unjust word, that JAMES D. WARREN has ever spoken to him. The relations of employer and employed, of chief and of subordinate, have been cemented in mutual esteem, sustained with mutual friendship, and consecrated to mutual assistance, encouragement and success.</p><p>To all this death, with stunning force, has put an end. The name of JAMES D. WARREN is taken from the list of the living to be recorded in the annals of eternity as one of those who loved his fellow-men. Those of us who have felt the warmth of that love find words but a feeble medium for the expression of our loss today. And the bitter pang of bereavement is intensified by the thought which oppresses every man in the COMMERCIAL&rsquo;s staff today, that time will not bring mitigation with it, but rather that it will force upon us a realization of the fact that JAMES D. WARREN, while not a man who gave his heart without caution or without test, did grapple to his soul the friends whose adoption he had tried, and never allowed disloyalty, or selfishness, or injustice on his part to sully that friendship. Every man in the COMMERCIAL office today feels and knows that he has lost a tried friend, a true friend, a noble friend, when those fatal words were heard last night–”It is all over.”</p><p>JAMES D. WARREN DEAD.</p><p>Buffalo Express, (Editorial).</p><p>At half-past eight last evening JAMES D. WARREN died. For some weeks there have been fears that the illness from which he suffered intensely would prove fatal; but lately his physicians were led to believe that the disease had taken a more favorable turn, and expectation of his full recovery were hopefully entertained. Only yesterday morning friends learned that he had pass a very comfortable night. During the day it was deemed necessary and safe to perform upon him a painful operation, and the most favorable result was confidently anticipated. But the effort was too much for his depleted vitality; he did not rally from the consequent exhaustion, but passed away unconscious even of the great relief caused by the dreaded operation.</p><p>From the very first attack he had expected, almost hoped for, death. He knew that his disease was mortal; his venerated father died of it, after enduring untold agony at intervals for several years; and when the son learned of his fatal inheritance, he seemed to wish for speedy ending of it rather to live in such suffering as he had witnessed at his beloved parent’s bedside. This was the most unfavorable aspect of his illness. It was the natural impatience of bodily ills which marks the strong and healthy man.</p><p>For even when past three-score MR. WARREN was a walking picture of robust health, a model of manly comeliness and strength. Few men of years could compare with him in those respects, and none of his age looked younger. He was made on a large scale, and up to the last two months looked good for another score years or more. There is something inexpressably sad in the thought of this strong man cut down so quickly in what seemed to be the very pride of his strength and the utmost height of his usefulness.</p><p>Elsewhere the <em>Express</em> prints such particulars of his life as could be hastily gathered in the few hours left after the sad news came to us before these columns must be closed for the day. Here it is not intended to do more than to speak briefly of Mr. WARREN’S marked characteristics, as they struck one who was more closely associated with him for fifteen years. The memory of those fifteen years of intimate friendship and perfect confidence is stronger and even fresher now, and will be more enduring, than the recollection of anything that has unpleasantly occurred between them in the nine years since.</p><p>MR. WARREN was eminently a man of business, with all of an upright business-man’s keen regard for his commercial reputation. His financial credit was always higher than that of many men of double his wealth. It was his first concern. In business affairs he was prudent and discreet, and successful of course. He made few losses, and knew how to keep what he had gained. Those who think of him first as a politician, as so many will, mistake his leading trait. He was first of all, a man of business. Circumstances, not of his own choosing, made him a political leader, and for the last five years hardly any Republican in the State of New York wielded a greater influence than he easily exerted in shaping the party’s actions in it nominating conventions both local and national.</p><p>Yet, but ten years ago, it was difficult to persuade Mr. WARREN to remain on the state committee, and he had absolutely no political ambition. He cared nothing for political power or honor. Yet, within the last two or three years, he was a candidate for the highest honors and greatest leadership his party in this state could bestow. Such wonderful changes will a few years work in men and things! And yet he was peculiarly a man of common sense. Political ambition, if it was in him ever, was a plant of late growth and an exotic at that. If he sought office it was because other men sorely wanted him to have it.</p><p>Many friends who think they knew Mr. WARREN pretty well will find it hard to believe all this of him. But it is the truth. He labored more zealously to promote other men’s ambitions than his own. Left to his own devices he would lately have lived a life of ease, in the enjoyment of the wealth which he had acquired in honorable business pursuits. He was fond of home and simple surroundings. He was justly proud of his ownership of the BUFFALO COMMERCIAL ADVERTISER, and the fine printing business and splendid building with which that time-honoured title is identified. But he had no false pride of any kind. He felt himself the equal of most men, but was never lofty with the lowly. In his domestic relations his life was beyond reproach. He was devoted to wife and children and generous with those of his blood not so near or dear.</p><p>JAMES D. WARREN.</p><p>Buffalo Courier, (Editorial.)</p><p>Although Buffalo was at the bedside of JAMES D. WARREN, for many weeks, sympathizing deeply with his sufferings and keenly aware of the dangerous nature of his illness, yet Buffalo was not prepared for the shock caused last evening by the announcement of his death. This community can scarcely realize that he has gone. Throughout the many long days of his suffering the public sentiment in many ways showed how earnest and fervent was the hope of the city that he would survive the desperate struggle, and of late the feeling of confidence in his recovery had grown strong and stronger from day to day. But it was not to be; and hope has been buried beneath a universal sorrow.</p><p>Long prominent and influential in the public and business affairs of Buffalo, Mr. WARREN was closely identified with the growth and prosperity of the city. That he contributed much to that growth and prosperity is well known. His notably successful newspaper establishment is conspicuous and convincing proof of that fact. And the entire city mourns his loss.</p><p>Genial, approachable, companionable, frank and straightforward in speech, he was ever surrounded by a host of warm personal friends. “True to his friends.” How often and how constantly was that said of Mr. WARREN! And never was a high compliment more richly merited. Here at his home and everywhere throughout the state how deeply do these personal friends mourn his loss.</p><p>Long active and influential in the councils of his party, no man in Wester New York was for many years so often sought for advice by party friends, and his power in local, state and national politics was recognized by all. He was a sturdy partisan, and this quality gained for him admirers among his political opponents. They had high regard for him as a man who always had the courage of his political convictions, and among those who bow in deepest sorrow over his bier are those who in many political contests have known his remarkably successful political management. They mourn the loss of an honorable opponent.</p><p>With the family of MR. WARREN and with those long intimately associated with him in his life’s work, the <em>Courier</em> has heart-felt sympathy in their great grief.</p><p>Syracuse Standard.</p><p>JAMES D. WARREN’S death follows weeks of serious illness, the fatal result of which had been anticipated by members of his family. Throughout New York State Mr. WARREN was widely known, and public interest in the news from his bedside has been marked. As a resident of the city of Buffalo, Mr. WARREN held a position of enviable prominence among his townsmen. For many years he was ranked with the leading journalists of the state, and he stood at the head of a prosperous and influential newspaper. He was the recognized leader of the republicans in two at least of the congressional districts of Western New York. He was recognized by this party as a leader of tact, skill and courage. In Syracuse the number of Mr. WARREN’S personal friends was large. They esteemed him highly and will learn of his death with much regret.</p><p>Rochester Democrat.</p><p>Journalism and politics in the state of New York have both suffered a severe loss in the death of JAMES D. WARREN, principal proprietor and responsible editor of the BUFFALO COMMERCIAL ADVERTISER. Mr. WARREN had been upon a sick bed for several weeks, and great solicitude had been expressed concerning the issue. Recent information had, however, been of an encouraging character and earnest hopes of his recovery had been entertained by his friends. But this was not to be, the strong man had gone to his death, at the summit of his reputation and at the meridian of his usefulness, leaving many to mourn his departure.</p><p>For the past nine years, the COMMERCIAL has substantially been JAMES D. WARREN, reflecting his views and enunciating his policies, and it has justly been regarded as one of the most influential republican journals in the state, clear in its utterances and fearless in its cause. It has been edited with marked ability, and has expressed the mind of its owner. Its help has been sought eagerly, and its criticisms have been feared. It has been unswerving in its fealty to republican principles and much of party integrity and triumph in Western New York has been due to its counsel.</p><p>Until MR. WARREN assumed control of the COMMERCIAL he had not achieved a state reputation as a politician, although locally he was known as one of the most sagacious of party managers. His new position, however, at once gave him state prominence. He soon became a member of the Republican state committee and, in due time, its chairman. In this capacity, he became one of the most efficient organizers the state has known. Although favoring the nomination of General Arthur for the presidency in 1884, he was, as chairman of the committee, loyal to the chosen standard-bearer, and did splendid service in behalf of Mr. Blaine. It was certainly not his fault that the gallant republican leader was defeated, by a meagre majority. Rapidly advancing in the confidence of the party, MR. WARREN has, more than once, been prominently mentioned in connection with the United States senatorship, and, in 1885, he was a prominent candidate for governor, before the republican state convention. High political honors were certainly in store for him, had his life been spared.</p><p>An analysis of the quality of JAMES D. WARREN reveals him a man of commanding influence—a leader of men—of signal sagacity and prudence and unswerving attachment to causes he espoused and men he favored. No man in the state wielded larger influence in his local political community than he. Among the republicans of Erie county his will was law, for years; but he was never known to abuse his power or to forfeit the trust reposed in him. In the factional disturbances of the party in this state Mr. WARREN was pronounced in his position, but he never thereby lost the respect even of those who felt constrained to differ with him, and the <em>Democrat and Chronicle</em>, rarely in accord with him during the troublous period indicated, takes pleasure in testifying to this. He was a frank opponent, as well as a staunch friend. He enjoyed the friendship of President Arthur and many eminent public men. In his bearing he was urbane. As a citizen he was public-spirited, and in the domestic circle, exceedingly beloved. Fortune smiled upon him, and he was liberal in his charities. It was his pleasure to help others, and many are the men occupying places of trust and honor who own them to his kindly offices. Few men in the state will be more sadly missed than JAMES D. WARREN.</p><p>Utica Herald.</p><p>JAMES D. WARREN, proprietor of the BUFFALO COMMERCIAL ADVERTISER, died at this home in that city last evening. He had been in failing health for some time, and, although there were occasional indications that he might recover, the end had seemed for several months not far distant. MR. WARREN will be very kindly remembered by people in the journalistic profession as a man who established an influential newspaper by hard work and sturdy business integrity. In the political arena he had been a staunch republican, when an expression of his opinions meant something, and the party will generously treasure his memory.</p><p>Buffalo Times.</p><p>Mr. WARREN has always been an earnest and active republican, never turning aside from his party of from that he considered fidelity to its principles. Although he has never been an office-holder other than we have stated his counsels have always been listed to and of late years he had been one of the most striking figures in the party both in state and national affairs. He has served repeatedly as a member of the state committee and as chairman thereof, has been delegate to bothy state and national nominating conventions. He was recognized as the leader of the straight-out or “stalwart” element in his party and had no patience with those who yielded up party allegiance to personal preference. He was a great and close observer, a thorough student of human nature and a very finished manipulator of men. So passes away a man who only a few short weeks ago was up and down our streets, the embodiment of health, strength, and manly vigor. The <em>Times</em> unites with the whole people and with the press in offering condolences and sincere sympathy to the afflicted family in this, the hour of their deep bereavement.</p></blockquote><figcaption>

JAMES D. WARREN.</p><p>Sketch of His Life, and Political Career.— Expressions of Sorrow at His Demise.</p><p>The death of MR. JAMES D. WARREN occurred last evening at 8.30, at his residence on North street. The sad news quickly became generally known throughout the city, and heartfelt expressions of regret and sorrow were heard on every hand. Toward those most deeply bereaved, the sentiment of sympathy and condolence was universal.</p><p>Mr. WARREN&rsquo;S illness dates from early in October. He went to New York to confer with the Republican State Committee, and returned quite indisposed, being threatened with local inflammatory troubles. Toward the last of October his physician, Dr. J. D. Hill, advised him to remain at home, and submit to treatment, which he did. The last time be was out was on election day, when he visited the polls and cast his vote. For a time his ailment apparently yielded to treatment, and hopes of his recovery were confidently expressed.</p><p>On the Friday before Thanksgiving he felt better than for several days previous. On the next day unfavorable symptoms set in and Dr. Burwell was called in as counsel. The doctor said that while alarming symptoms were present they were not necessarily fatal. Here was a staunch ship to use Dr. Burwell’s words, that had been sailing over 60 years. The ship had got on the rocks, but he trusted they could float her. New complications, however, arose, and about ten days ago a swelling, supposed to be an abcess, began to develop on the left thigh, near the groin.</p><p>It was at first thought to be merely sympathetic with his bladder trouble, but it did not disappear, and on Dr. Hill’s becoming ill, Dr. Roswell Park was called, who, with Dr. Burwell, concluded to open the swelling, on the supposition of its being an abcess. The operation was performed yesterday and the patient bore it with the utmost courage. An hour later he suffered a severe chill, followed by a high fever. His temperature rose to 105 and his pulse to 140, and he soon became unconscious, from which state he never rallied. Late in the afternoon the physicians gave up hope and, at 8.30, he ceased to breathe, and passed peacefully away.</p><p>SKETCH OF HIS LIFE,</p><p>JAMES D. WARREN was born in the town of Bennington, Wyoming county, N. Y., on the 19th of January, 1823. His father, the late Orsamus Warren, was a farmer and one of the pioneers of Western New York. After a brief residence in Bennington he moved to the town of Wales, Erie county, and from thence shortly afterwards to the town of Clarence, Erie county, where be purchased and settled upon a farm situated about a mile from the village. He also carried on a country store at Clarence. When the family moved to Clarence the subject of this notice was about two years old. He attended school, wrought upon the farm and assisted his father in the management of the village store. Before he attained his majority MR. WARREN made a tour of the South, spending about a year in Natchez, Miss. Returning North, he engaged in business in Clarence, following mercantile and farming pursuits, and was elected a Supervisor for several terms from that town. In 1854, at the age of 31, Mr. WARREN was elected County Treasurer, and served a term of three years. He subsequently held the office of Clerk of the Board of Supervisors for two or three terms, and in April, 1861, in connection with Rufus Wheeler and Joseph Candee, he purchased the COMMERCIAL ADVERTISER, and thus began his career as a publisher, which he continued the time of his death. In 1862 Messrs. Wheeler and Warren purchased Mr. Candee&rsquo;s interest, and immediately after Mr. James N. Matthews was admitted into the firm. Mr. Wheeler retired from business some years afterwards, and the firm then became Matthews & Warren. In 1877 the partnership was dissolved, Mr. Matthews retiring, and since then Mr. WARREN the thenceforth to had been sole proprietor of the COMMERCIAL.</p><p>MR. WARREN had been for some years president of White’s Bank of Buffalo. He was twice married, his first wife being Miss Laura Love, daughter of the late George Love; by her he had one son, Mr. Orsamus G. Warren. His second wife, who survives him, was Miss Mary Mills, daughter of the late Judge Mills, of Clarence, by whom he had one son, Mr. William C. Warren, and two daughters, the eldest of whom is the wife of Mr. Isaac Bromley.</p><p>MR. WARREN&rsquo;S POLITICAL CAREER.</p><p>The deceased early in life manifested an active interest in public affairs, and up to the day of prostration by his fatal sickness he took a deep, active and earnest interest in politics. His last trip to New York city, made when he should have been at home, was in the interest of the republican cause, and to counsel with republican friends. Before leaving Clarence be became the recognized leader of his party in the town, and upon removal to the city at once acquired prominence in city and state political affairs. During the protracted and hard struggle which transferred the management and control of republican affairs in this state from the friends of the late Senator Fenton to those of Senator Conkling, MR. WARREN took a conspicuous and active part.</p><p>He was a delegate to the Syracuse convention of 1871 in which those two political giants had their last encounter, and had a solid Conkling delegation from Erie county behind him. Mr. WARREN was a delegate to nearly every state convention from that time until 1885. He was also a member of the state committee during the greater part of that period, and he was forced into the chairmanship in 1883, the year after the great Cleveland cyclone, when the republican ranks in this state were badly broken and the party greatly demoralized. He succeeded so well in bringing the contending factions together that the State was reclaimed to the republicans by the election of the head of their ticket—Gen. Carr, for secretary of state —while the democratic majority for the remainder of the ticket was cut merest margin. Because of his success on that occasion and his manifest desire to deal fairly and honorably with all republicans regardless of past factional differences, Mr. Blaine personally urged him, although the leader of the Arthur forces at Chicago, to take the chairmanship of the state committee in the presidential campaign. MR. Warren strongly opposed some of the steps of the closing days of that campaign, to which the defeat of Mr. Blaine is directly attributable. He was opposed to the Delmonico dinner, and counseled against the ministers’ meeting at which the Rev. Dr. Burchard made use of his ill-advised phrase, &ldquo;Rum, Romanism, and Rebellion.” It was Mr. Warren&rsquo;s judgment that if the meeting was held at all the speakers should first write out what they intended to say and submit the manuscript to the party managers, but the national committee looked upon this as a needless precaution and the advice was disregarded.</p><p>Throughout the campaign of 1884 MR. WARREN gave unflagging personal attention to the work. He spent nearly three months in New York city, devoting all his time and attention to the labor of the committee. The strain was so terrible that he barely escaped nervous prostration, and for this reason firmly declined to go on the committee again.</p><p>Mr. Warren was a delegate-at-large to the National republican convention at Chicago in 1880, the other three delegates-at-large being Senator Conkling, General Arthur and Governor Cornell. He was one of General Grant&rsquo;s leaders in that convention, and one of the memorable 306 who stood solidly by their soldier candidate to the end. He was again a delegate to the National republican convention in 1884, and was the recognized leader of Artbur’s forces in that convention, for whom he had the greatest admiration and the warmest love. This latter sentiment was reciprocated by General Arthur. On the occasion of MR. WARREN’S last visit to New York, in October last, alluded to above, he called upon his dear friend, on who hand of death was then heavily resting. When taking his leave of him MR. WARREN could not restrain his feelings, realizing that it would be the last time he would ever see him on earth. Arthur took his hand in both of his, exclaiming, with deep emotion: “WARRREN, I love you, and always have!”</p><p>Mr. WARREN’S name was prominently canvassed in connection with the United-States senatorship, when Mr. Evarts was elected. He was a candidate for the nomination for governor in the Saratoga convention of 1885, receiving 138 votes.</p><p>** Expressions of Sorrow.**</p><p>At the meeting of the Charter Revision Committee at the Mayor’s office last evening, the death of MR. WARREN was announced, in feeling terms, by Mr. James C. Fullerton. In moving the appointment of a committee of three to draft suitable resolutions, Mr. Fullerton said it was unnecessary for him to say anything in eulogy of a man who commanded so deeply the respect and sympathy of such a body as that present, who knew and appreciated the merits of Mr. WARREN as a citizen, and his great services to the community as a public man. He had always placed uppermost in his breast the dictates of duty. The motion that the chairman appoint a committee of three to draft suitable resolutions to be presented at the next meeting was seconded by Mayor Becker. The chair appointed Mr. James C. Fullerton, Mr. George Gorham and Gen. John C. Graves.</p><p>The <em>Courier</em> of this morning in announcing the death of MR. WARREN, says:</p><p>One of the best and most valuable citizens Buffalo ever had was lost when at half-past eight o&rsquo;clock last evening, at his residence on North street, JAMES D. WARREN died. He had lain for several weeks on a bed of extreme suffering, with life from day to day trembling in the balance—a report of slight improvement occasionally relieving the solicitude of the community, only to be quickly followed by the intelligence that the promise of the symptoms had proven fallacious—yet to those who saw him but a comparatively little while ago in apparently rugged health and with an intellect a tower of strength, his taking off must seem a sudden dispensation. In the city of his home MR. WARREN’s death will be universally mourned; and the mourning will extend far beyond its borders, for his acquaintance throughout the state, and indeed the nation, was large, his reputation being that of a sturdily honest, and to an extent self-made man who did important service in the councils of the party of his preference and would perhaps have received high political honors had his life been prolonged. Quick witted, with broad intellectual grasp, and the peculiar faculty for managing men, MR. WARREN was long a recognized power in the local political and business spheres. He loved Buffalo and was always ready with his support for what he conceived to be its best interests.</p><p>The <em>Express</em> contains brief interviews with several well-known personal friends of MR. WARREN, which are herewith reprinted:</p><p>A BANKING FRIEND.</p><p>Gen. Rufus L. Howard, who was called upon at a late hour last night, said that he had been very much surprised at the news of MR. WARREN&rsquo;S death.</p><p>Gen. Howard said he hardly felt able that evening to say much with respect to MR. WARREN’s life or his personal knowledge of him as a friend. &ldquo;I have known him,” he said, “ever since I came to Buffalo, and have always entertained for him a warn regard. He was a clear-headed, shrewd business man, and in all his business relations, as far as I am enabled to say, was perfectly upright and a pleasant man to meet.</p><p>“My business relations with him have been closer since I became Vice-President of White&rsquo;s Bank. Since his sickness I have taken more or less charge of the bank’s affairs, and tomorrow I shall call a meeting of the directors, as of course the bank cannot be closed immediately.”</p><p>A DEMOCRATIC FRIEND.</p><p>Judge James M. Humphrey, who has known MR. WARREN 35 years, said of him at his own home last night: &ldquo;He was a remarkably good business man in every department of business, He was an honest, upright man. He was a profound judge of men—of human nature. He had largely the elements and characteristics that made him a leader among men, in politics especially. He was a strong partisan, yet not so strong as to do injustice to the motives of those opposed to him. He had strong, decided, and positive convictions, and followed them out with both determination and sagacity. I think him to have been one of the leading men whose opinions and judgment were as highly regarded in the state as any man in his party occupying a private position, He exercised a controlling—a very controlling interest in the political action of his party in this county and had done, so for a good many years. MR. WARREN was, moreover, a man Of fine social qualities, and genial nature. He appreciated his friends and was true to them. His death will be a great loss to the business community and to his party.”</p><p>A BUSINESS FRIEND.</p><p>Alfred P. Wright, an old friend of MR. WARREN, was grieved to learn of his death. “Personally,” said he, &ldquo;I feel that I have lost a very dear friend. I have known him for a great many years, intimately. I have always been associated with him in politics, with the exception of one year, when we differed, but that did not interfere with our personal friendship. He was a strong, sterling, upright man. Occupying the position he did, he could not help making some political mistakes and some political enemies.</p><p>“His integrity was above suspicion. He was very strong in his friendships, and had the faculty of holding the friends he made. He was the most lovable man to his family that you can possibly imagine. I feel that the city of Buffalo has lost one of its best men, whose place it will be hard to fill—one who has battled for years for Buffalo and its interests.&rdquo;</p><p>A POLITICAL FRIEND.</p><p>The Hon. Benjamin H. Williams got the news of MR. WARREN&rsquo;S death from a reporter of the <em>Express</em>. Said he:</p><p>“I feel his death is a great personal loss to me on the score of friendship. I had a very high opinion of MR. WARREN as a citizen, and as a man I had great esteem for him. I regard his death as a great loss, not only to his family but to his immediate friends, the community, and I might also say to the state.”</p><p>A BOYHOOD FRIEND.</p><p>The Hon. Nelson K. Kopkins was deeply grieved when he learned the sad news. &ldquo;I believe I have been acquainted with MR. WARREN longer than any other man in the city,” said Mr. Hopkins, &ldquo;having become acquainted with him during his early boyhood. He was during the early part of his life, a steady, faithful and industrious young man. When I first knew him he was a clerk in his father’s store in Clarence Hollow. Since he has been a resident of Buffalo, his character has been almost too well known to the public for me to dwell on it. He has always occupied a high and honorable position.</p><p>&ldquo;We have always belonged to the same party. He has achieved a reputation as a citizen and in his party as a gentleman that is not excelled by any other man. He has always been a man of very high character and undoubted integrity. His loss will be greatly felt throughout the entire community.”</p></blockquote><figcaption>

WARREN.</p><p>Action of the Republican Executive Committee.—A Tribute by the &ldquo;Commercial” Compositors and Employees.</p><p>ACTION OF THE REPUBLICAN EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE.</p><p>At a regular meeting of the Republican Executive Committee of the County of Erie, held at the County Committee Rooms this morning at half-past ten, the following resolutions on the death of Mr. WARREN were unanimously adopted:</p><p>It is with feeling of pained surprise and regret that we learn that JAMES D. WARREN is dead.</p><p>The leader of the Republican party in We New York has passed away, leaving a vacancy in our ranks not soon or easy to be filled. His was the saving common sense on which so often the party has leaned for support; his was the prudent conservatism which demanded time to wisely investigate and carefully act. His was the unswerving fidelity to friends which stood unshaken through good and evil reports and which, though often tried, never failed in the hour of need.</p><p>His name will live in the history of the republican party associated with those for whom he toiled and who honored him for his real worth–the genial, whole-souled gentleman, Chester A. Arthur, the noble-minded upright Judge, Charles J. Folger.</p><p>Let others tell of his sterling business ability, of his untiring industry and indefatigable perseverance which have placed the moneyless lad among the merchant princes of our city. To us his death comes with a sense of personal bereavement. We shall miss his noble presence, his unfailing courage, his manly hope. We shall miss his words of wise counsel, his knowledge of men and affairs. We are sensible that in the structure of Republicanism a great pillar has fallen and contemplating the space it has left, we realize that the loss exceeds any mere private grief and becomes a public calamity. On the shaft which may honor his memory might well be written the two words which best describe his character “Firm and True.” We do not venture to intrude into the private grief of his family circle. In a tribute of deep sympathy in this hour of affliction we respectfully unite with all citizens of the city which he loved so much and which honored and respected him.</p><p>In honor of his memory our rooms shall be draped in mourning for the space of thirty days.</p><p>ACTION OF THE “COMMERCIAL” NEWSROOM COMPOSITORS.</p><p>A meeting of the compositors of the COMMERCIAL newsroom was held at noon today to take action on the death of Mr. WARREN. The foreman, Mr. N. W. Thayer, was called to the chair, and Mr. Anthony W. Landsittel chosen secretary. On motion, a committee consisting of Ferdinand Puls, George F. Hilbert. Don Wight, Herman Metke, and Judson A. Taylor, was appointed, to prepare a suitable memorial. They reported the following which was unanimously adopted:</p><p>We, the compositors and employees of the BUFFALO COMMERCIAL ADVERTISER&rsquo;S news room wish to put on record some expression of the sorrow with which the death of JAMES D. WARREN our late employer and friend bas filled us.</p><p>MR. WARREN has been to all of us, as an employer, as fair and just as man could be. He never made a promise that he did not fulfill to the letter. He never encouraged hopes that he had reason to believe could not be realized. What he said to us we knew he meant; we knew that it could be depended upon.</p><p>Many of us have gone to MR. WARREN in times of trouble for counsel or for assistance. It is a pleasure, as well as a duty, to say at this time that we never failed to get good advice, real sympathy and judicious aid. Our employer was always our kindly well-wisher and true friend. We mourn his too-early death sincerely and beg his sorrowing family to accept our sympathy and this memorial as a proof of our real affection for MR. WARREN, and our regard for those he loved best.</p><p>ACTION OF EMPLOYEES OF THE JOB DEPARTMENT.</p><p>A meeting of the employees of the job department of the COMMERCIAL ADVERTISER Printing House, was held at 1 o&rsquo;clock this afternoon, to take action on the death of MR. WARREN. Mr. F. R. Turner presided, and a committee, consisting of Jacob Pfohl, Alfred Paddon and C. J. Wolfe was appointed on resolutions. They reported the following memorial which was adopted:</p><p>We, the employees of the COMMERCIAL ADVERTISER job-printing department, feel deeply grieved at the untimely death of our honored friend and employer, MR. JAMES D. WARREN. We bear testimony to the fact that he was always kind and considerate in his treatment of us, and we, one and all, had reason to regard him as a kind, just and consistent friend.</p><p>As an employer he had our fullest respect. We admired his many noble qualities and the justness of his dealings. To his family we offer our deepest sympathy in this the time of their great loss and assure them that we too are mourners.</p><p>MR. WARREN&rsquo;S sterling qualities of heart and mind are too well-known to the community at large to need extended eulogy at our hands, but it is at such a time as this that we can best appreciate his great worth and feel the deep loss that has fallen upon us.</p><p>He was fair and honorable to all, We deeply deplore his loss, and sincerely regret that death has severed the pleasant relations always sustained between him and those who entered his service.</p></blockquote><figcaption>

The remote cause of death was inflammation of the bladder. Mr. Warren was first taken ill early in October but despite an enervating attack he persisted on going to New York as a proxy on the State committee but returned to this city in a worse state of health than when he departed.</p><p>Mr. Warren was born at Bennington, Wyoming county, N. Y., January 19, 1823. He was a son of Orsamus Warren one of the earliest settlers in the western part of this state. Mr. Warren was a farm bred boy spending most of his time up to the age of 31 in the rural districts. When he was but two years of age his parents moved to Clarence, this county, where they started a store as well as a farm.</p><p>In 1854 Mr. Warren&rsquo;s city life, and in fact his real public career began although he had before that time served several terms as supervisor. In the year named he was elected treasurer of Erie county and soon came into prominence by his wisdom in counsel and earnestness for party. Mr. Warren continued as county treasurer for the term of three years. He was afterwards elected clerk of the board of supervisors, holding that office several years. In April, 1861, he made the most important move in his career, and one by which he was to become a power in the land: with Joseph Wheeler and Joseph Candee he purchased the <em>Buffalo Commercial Advertiser</em>. In 1862 one of Mr. Warren’s partners stepped out and James N. Matthews was taken in. A year or two after Jos. Wheeler followed Candee into private life and then was born the firm for years of great power and prominence of Matthews & Warren. For fifteen years the two partners tried to follow the paths of prosperity. Then they separated. With the story of that disunion the Buffalo public is familiar. Since Mr. Matthews’ retirement from the firm Mr. Warren guided its fortunes alone and with continued success. Mr. Warren was at the time of his death the president of White’s bank. He was married twice, first to Miss Laura Love and after her death to Miss Mary Mills. By the first marriage he had one son, Orsamus G. Warren, and by the second one son and two daughters. Mr. Warren leaves surviving him his widow, two sons and one daughter, Mrs. Isaac Bromley, jr.</p><p>Many people in the city will sincerely sympathize with the family in their affliction and realize the loss the republican party has sustained in the death of its leader in Erie county.</p></blockquote><figcaption>

This time he has claimed for his victim one of our leading and most influential citizens, a man of sterling worth. His loss will not only be felt within the confines of our city, but throughout the broad extent of our whole state. James D. Warren passed from this life last evening at a little after nine o’clock. His taking off will be deeply and sincerely regretted by the whole community. He was born in the town of Bennington, Wyoming Co., N. Y., on the 19th day of January, 1823. His early life was spent on the farm and in the country store owned by his father, the late Orsamus Warren, one of the pioneers of Western New York. Just before attaining his majority he visited the southern states and was a resident of Natchez, Miss., for about a year. He was a supervisor from the town of Clarence, where the family had lived since he was two years of age, for a number of terms. In 1854 he was elected county treasurer, serving a term of three years. He subsequently served as clerk to the board of supervisors for a number of terms, and in April of 1861 he entered upon his life work of publisher by purchasing in connection with Joseph Candee, the Buffalo Commercial Advertiser. Later, in 1862, Mr. Candee gave place in the firm to Mr. Wheeler who two years later retired in favor of James N. Matthews. In 1877 Mr. Warren became by purchase the sole owner of the paper and remained so until the time of his death. He has always been an earnest and active Republican, never turning aside from his party or from that he considered fidelity to its principles. Although he has never been an office-holder other than we have stated his counsels have always been listened to and of late years he has been one of the most striking figures in the party both in state and national affairs. He has served repeatedly as a member of the state committee and as chairman thereof, has been delegate to both state and national nominating conventions. He was recognized as the leader of the straight out or “stalwart” element in his party and had no patience with those who yielded up party allegiance to personal preference. He was a great and close observer, a thorough student of human nature and a finished manipulator of men. Had he lived there is no question but that he would have been the next standard bearer of his party in the contest for the governor’s chair and for the supremacy of the party in the state.</p><p>So passes away a man who only a few short weeks ago was up and down our streets, the embodiment of health, strength and manly vigor. THE TIMES unites with the whole people and with the press in offering condolences and sincere sympathy to the afflicted family in this, the hour of their deep bereavement.</p></blockquote><figcaption>

The examination showed that the cause of Mr. Warren&rsquo;s sickness and death was the formation of a large abscess back of the left kidney, containing a quart or more of matter, which had burrowed its way down in search of an outlet to the left groin, where it came to a point, and in order to facilitate this discharge Dr. Park made an opening into it. The abscess, it was found, would inevitably have resulted in death. Otherwise all the organs were in a condition not incompatible with the return of health, and a number of minor complications would have been readily subject to cure.</p><p>The family has received a great many letters of condolence from nearly all the prominent men of the party throughout the State and from Washington.</p><p>The funeral will take place from the family residence, No. 222 North Street, on Monday at 2.30 P.M., the burial to be at the convenience of the family. The body is to rest temporarily in a vault at Forest Lawn. It has not yet been decided whether he will be interred at Clarence, his old home.</p><p><strong>Formal Expressions of Sorrow.</strong></p><p>Meetings were held by a number of organizations yesterday and their grief at the death of James D. Warren was formally expressed. The special meeting of the Buffalo Republican League last evening was largely attended. President Ogden P. Letchworth, in stating the sad duty for the League had met, fittingly referred to the great loss which City and State have suffered. He called upon, as better qualified to speak of the work and worth of Mr. Warren, Mr. S. C. Adams, an honorary member of the organization, and for many yours a bosom friend of Mr. Warren. Mr. Adams was visibly affected, and as he spoke was so deeply moved that his voice was controlled with difficulty. His acquaintance with Mr. Warren dated from 1852, when the latter represented Clarence in the Board of Supervisors, and he himself represented Collins. He had learned to love him as a brother.</p><p>Messr. Seward A. Simonds, Emory P. Close, and William L. Marcy were appointed a committee to draft a suitable memorial, which as read by Mr. Simons as follows:</p><p>The Republican League has learned with deep sorrow of the death of James D. Warren, and unites in the genuine sentiment of public bereavement which is universal in this community.</p><p>Mr. Warren drew to himself with rare attractiveness a host of loyal friends, because he himself never betrayed one whose friendship he enjoyed. His name was a synonym of financial integrity, business worth, and untiring energy. His political life was one of conscientious fidelity and consistent devotion to a great party in whose principles he believed, the confidence of whose honored leaders he merited and received. His unswerving loyalty was marked by no personal ambition, his service was freely bestowed with no thought of recompense in position or power. His integrity of purpose never recognized a selfish end, he was a worthy leader, a trusted friend, a broad and liberal man, and a pure-minded citizen.</p><p>As a mark of respect to his memory, it is appropriate that the rooms of the League be draped in mourning for 30 days.</p><p>Mr. Simons moved the adoption of the resolution, Mr. Close in seconding the motion said:</p><p>In the funeral hush and shadow of Mr. Warren&rsquo;s death it is difficult to fitly speak. We are met here to pay honor and homage to the memory of a pure man, a distinguished citizen, and a brave leader, To me the announcement comes with the oppressive weight of a deep personal loss. It was my privilege to know Mr. Warren intimately. During the Presidential campaign of 1884, when Mr. Warren was chairman of the State Committee, at his request, I accompanied him to New-York, and remained during the last two months of that active campaign, and had many opportunities of appreciating his administrative skill, able leadership, and unfaltering zeal. Strength, candor, and loyalty were the leading characteristics of his nature. His strength was shown in a firmness of purpose and conviction which could brook no opposition; in an energy and enterprise which commanded and achieved success. His candor was exhibited by his open and ingenious utterances. His friends could always rely upon the assurances of his aid ; his foes were promptly advised of an opposition which gave and asked no quarter. With him, the promise to the ear was never broken to the hope; his speech was ever the transparent vesture of his thought. His loyalty was demonstrated by an adherence to principle and to friend which never wavered, never doubted, never failed.</p><p>Mr. Warren was the truly valiant man, who dared nothing but what he should; who feared nothing but what he ought. Noble in life, he is splendid in ashes, and will be eminent in the grave. He has gone from us forever, Nothing remains for us but to indulge ourselves in that sweet anxiety which arises from the memory of a great affliction. He at last has joined the everlasting majority. He leaves behind him the recollection of</p><p>Only those actions of the just</p><p>Which smell sweet and blossom in the dust.</p><p>Mr. N.S. Rosenau, in briefly paying his tribute of respect to Mr. Warren&rsquo;s memory, dwelt especially upon the great modesty of the man, who, while a leader, was contented and glad to remain in the ranks. He had made it his ambition to make famous the names and careers of other men. It was but fitting that the League should endeavor to keep green the memory of him who sought no honor for himself.</p><p>Mr. John Laughlin spoke with eloquent feeling. Mr. Warren had often befriended and wisely counseled him. When the speaker came to Buffalo Mr. Warren was the on!y man he knew here, having previously met him at Washington. One quality specially worthy of mention, he said, was the fact that Mr. Warren&rsquo;s strongest friendships were among men younger than himself. The pleasantest part of his life had been spent with young men. He wanted to be one of the &ldquo;boys&rdquo; and be with the boys. As young Republicans, the League mourned his untimely death, because in him they had a friend, a true and trusted leader. Those who knew him best mourned his loss as a man whose friendship could never be replaced.</p><p>The memorial was unanimously adopted and on motion the House Committee was instructed to drape the rooms of the League in mourning for 30 days.</p><p>Upon motion a committer of active and honorary members, of which President Letchworth is chairman, was appointed to represent the League at the funeral of the deceased. All members of the League are invited to join the committee at the rooms of the League at 1.30 o&rsquo;clock to-morrow afternoon. With the chairman, the members of the committee are: Messrs. S. Cary Adams, Philo D. Beard, N. C, Barnum, Philip Becker, Alexander Brush, Emory P. Close, F. S. Crego, Frank S. Coit, James Crate, F. L, Danforth, W. C. Francis, F. C. Ferguson, John C. Graves, James F. Gluck, W. H. Gratwick, Samuel Higgins. R. R. Hefford, C. O. Howard, W, S, Jenkins, Josiah Jewett, Spencer Kellogg. John Laughlin, Thomas Loomis, William L. Marcy, Frank T. Moulton, Daniel H. McMillan, J. J. McWilliams, John Otto, Jr., Charles A. Pooley, A. E. Perrine, Pascal P. Pratt, H. T. Ramsdeil, N. S. Rosenau, A. J. Rich, P. A. Rosseel, D. L. Ransom, S. S.

Haffa, J. M. Provoost.</p><p>ACTION OF THE NEWSPAPER MEN.</p><p>A meeting of the Press Club and representatives of the press of Buffalo was held at the rooms of that organization last evening to take action on the death of Mr. Warren. President Mclntosh called the meeting to order, briefly stating its purpose and saying that it seemed proper though Mr. Warren had not been a member of the club, that the body take some action on his decease.</p><p>On motion of Mr. George Ferris, the Rev. Father Cronin was called to the chair, and on taking the seat he said that he should accuse himself of culpable neglect if he excused himself from attendance at the meeting upon the invitation he had received. It seemed at this time that the tongue was very weak to utter what the heart felt. Doubtless all were pained, as he was, to learn of Mr. Warren&rsquo;s death. Meditating upon it, it seemed as if some towering forest oak had been stricken with lightning from a summer sky, for he towered aloft not alone because of magnificent physique, but because of his indomitable energy and his wide, far-extending influence. He had often thought since he had become acquainted with Mr. Warren that he was a typical American in that he was a man of simple tastes and strong convictions which he had the courage to proclaim. He was a strong friend and an honorable foe. Like all great men he had the good fortune not to be born to enervating fortune. There was in him no lordly, offensive manner to repel those in the lower walks of life. He regarded himself as the peer of any man, but with his inferiors his relations were the pleasantest. In conclusion Father Cronin said he wished he could join those present in piercing the gloom that darkened the pleasure of his family in these merry days of Christmastide and assist in weaving a wreath of immortelles for our late departed journalistic friend, James D. Warren.</p><p>Mr. F. F. Fargo said he, too, regretted his loss. Mr. Warren was no ordinary man. The club did itself honor in seeking to do him honor. Though not a journalist, strictly speaking, he had been connected with journalism most of his life, and had occupied an enviable position in the front rank. His influence was not circumscribed by Buffalo, but was known throughout the State and country. To be thus stricken down in his prime was a terrible loss. He thought it fitting that the club should place on record some suitable memorial, and moved that a committee of five be appointed to express the sentiment of the meeting.</p><p>The chair appointed as such Messrs. F. F. Fargo, William McIntosh, Norman E. Mack, Matthias Rohr, and Arthur W. Austin.</p><p>While the committee was making its report, Mr. R. C. Hill took occasion to add a few words, saying that his experiences with and reminiscences of Mr. Warren were most satisfactory. He deplored the loss of one so respected, and one who so ably represented the journalistic profession in Buffalo. He hoped a general expression of the entire press, irrespective of club membership, would be obtained, as he was sure the whole press united in regretting the loss of this respected member.</p><p>Mr. Ambrose Butler took occasion to say that he was not personally related to Mr. Warren, but his brother had known him well. He had just received a telegram from Mr. E. H. Butler saying that he deeply regretted the death of his brother journalist, and united in paying a tribute to his memory,</p><p>Chairman Fargo then reported the following resolutions, which were unanimously adopted as the sentiment of the meeting:</p><p>The death of James D. Warren in the fullness and vigor of manhood is an incalculable loss to the City, the State, and the Nation. His influence and usefulness were not limited to municipal locality, but were felt throughout the Commonwealth, even extending to the boundaries of the Union itself.</p><p>Cast in a large mold, Mr. Warren instinctively took a broad and comprehensive view of affairs, and was readily recognized by his fellows as a leader of men. He was proverbially modest, never preferring nor urging his own claims or merits, but rather promoting those of others often less meritorious than his own.</p><p>Mr. Warren was a manly man. Always dignified and courteous, never trifling nor demeaning himself, he therefore commanded the respect of all classes of men. In society, business, and political affairs he occupied a place in the front rank and the place was not only occupied but filled. His knowledge of men and affairs seemed intuitive, his judgement as unerring as is possible for human opinions to be, and his integrity was without reproach and his death is an almost unbearable bereavement to his afflicted family.</p><p>The Press Club, speaking for itself and the press of the City of Buffalo, feel it an honor to place this brief testimonial upon the bier of one who has added luster to the profession of which it is a representative.</p><p><em>Resolved,</em> That the members of the club will attend the obsequies of Mr. Warren in a body, and invite members of the press generally to join them.</p><p><em>Resolved,</em> That an engrossed copy of the foregoing, attested by the officers of the club, be presented to the family of the deceased.</p><p>The resolutions as first read were indicative only of regret on the part of the Press Club, but on motion of Mr. R. C. Hill the words &ldquo;and the press of the City of Buffalo&rdquo; were interpolated and they were thus adopted.</p><p>Mr. Leslie Thorn paid a tribute to the memory of Mr. Warren in a few eloquent sentences saying that he deeply regretted the loss of a man whom he had known personally and who had made a deep and abiding impression upon the affairs of the city, while at the same time he took a melancholy pleasure in thus giving utterance to his regard for the deceased.</p><p>Mr. Matthias Rohr gave voice to sentiments of respect concerning the loss to the community of a man who was so great a figure in it, and whom he had known so well.</p><p>Mr. Arthur W. Austin said that in the editorial of the <em>Commercial</em> would be found the universal sentiments of its employees. He could only add emphasis to its sad truth. He felt deeply the loss of a kind, true, and steadfast friend, as did all his co-laborers.</p><p>Mr. Fargo moved that as the resolutions provided that the press should attend in a body, that a committee of arrangements be appointed by the chair to provide for this, and the following committee was named: Messrs. F. F. Fargo, George Bleistein, George M. Hausauer, E. H. Butler, Eugene Fleury, and Norman E. Mack.</p><p>The meeting then adjourned.</p><p>ACTION OF THE REPUBLICAN COUNTY EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE</p><p>The Republican County Executive Committee at a regular meeting yesterday morning adopted the following:</p><p>It is with feeling of pained surprise and regret that we learn that James D. Warren is dead.</p><p>The leader of the Republican party in Western New-York has passed away, leaving a vacancy in our ranks not soon or easily to be filled. His was the saving common sense on which so often the party has leaned for support; his was the prudent conservatism which demanded time to wisely investigate and carefully act. His was the unswerving fidelity to friend which stood unshaken through good and evil reports and which, though often tried, never failed in the hour of need.</p><p>His name will live in the history of the Republican party associated with those for whom he toiled and who honored him for his real worth—the genial, whole-souled gentleman, Chester A. Arthur, the noble-minded, upright Judge, Charles J. Folger.</p><p>Let others tell of his sterling business ability, of his untiring industry and indefatigable perseverance which have placed the moneyless lad among the merchant princes of our city. To us his death comes with a sense of personal bereavement. We shall miss his noble presence, his unfailing courage, his manly hope. We shall miss his words of wise counsel, his knowledge of men and affairs. We are sensible that in the structure of Republicanism a great pillar has fallen, and contemplating the space it has left, we realize that the loss exceeds any mere private grief and becomes a public calamity. On the shaft which may honor his memory might well be written the two words which best describe his character, “Firm and True.” We do not venture to intrude into the private grief of his family circle. In a tribute of deep sympathy in this hour of affliction we respectfully unit with all citizens of the city which he loved so much and which honored and respected him.</p><p>In honor of his memory our rooms shall be draped in mourning for the space of 30 days.</p><p>ACTION OF WHITE’S BANK DIRECTORS</p><p>White’s Bank was draped in mourning yesterday and the chair which the departed president, Mr. James D. Warren, was wont to occupy, bore the somber emblem of death. At 3.30 P. M. the directors held a special meeting and unanimously adopted the following resolutions presented by Mr. Nelson K. Hopkins:</p><p>We have heard with profound regret and sorrow of the death of the Hon. James D. Warren, the president of this bank, with whom we have been pleasantly associated for many years. He was an able and accomplished man of business, a warm and devoted friend, and an agreeable companion. He has been called to many important and responsible positions in life and he has filled them all with honor and credit.</p><p><em>Resolved</em>, That in the death of Mr. Warren this bank has lost a wise, honest and indefatigable officer, who has always had its success and prosperity at heart; that we individually have lost a valued friend, the bank a safe counselor, and this community a highly esteemed and worthy citizen.</p><p><em>Resolved</em>, That we extend to the family of the deceased our sympathy in its bereavement; that out of respect to his memory, this bank be draped in mourning for 30 days, and that this board attend the funeral in a body.</p><p><em>Resolved</em>, That these resolutions be entered in the minutes, and a copy be sent to the family of the deceased, and published in the daily papers of the city.</p><p>In reporting Gen. R. L. Howard’s remarks about Mr. Warren an indefinite expression was used, leading possibly to the inference that there was some thought of winding up White’s Bank on account of his death. This would certainly be a forced construction of the language, which was intended to convey the idea that the bank could not be closed, even temporarily, for the death or funeral of its lamented President.</p><p>ACTION OF THE DECEASED’S EMPLOYEES.</p><p>The compositors of the <em>Commercial</em> newsroom held a meeting yesterday noon to take action on Mr. Warren’s death. Mr. N. W. Thayer, the foreman, was called to the chair, and Mr. Anthony W. Landsittel was chosen secretary. Messrs. Ferdinand [unclear], George R. Hilbert, Don Wight, Herman Metke, and Judson A. Taylor, appointed a committee to draft a suitable memorial, presented the following which was adopted unanimously:</p><p>We, the compositors and employees of the <em>Buffalo Commercial Advertiser’s</em> newsroom, wish to put on record some expression of the sorrow with which the death of James D. Warren, our late employer and friend, has filled us.</p><p>Mr. Warren has been to all of us, as an employer as fair and just as man could be. He never made a promise that he did not fulfill to the letter. He never encouraged hopes that be had reason to believe could not be realized. What he said to us we knew he meant; we knew that it could be depended upon.</p><p>Many of us have gone to Mr. Warren in times of trouble for counsel or for assistance. It is a pleasure, as well as a duty, to say at this time that we never failed to get good advice, real sympathy, and judicious aid. Our employer was always our kindly well-wisher and true friend. We mourn his too-early death sincerely, and beg his sorrowing family to accept our sympathy and this memorial as a proof of our real affection for Mr. Warren, and our regard for those he loved best.</p><p>The employees of the <em>Commercial’s</em> job department held a meeting at 1 P. M. Mr. F. P. Turner presided. The following memorial, presented by a committee consisting of Messrs. Jacob Pfohl, Alfred Paddon, and C. J. Wolfe, was adopted:</p><p>We, the employees of the <em>Commercial Advertiser</em> job printing department, feel deeply grieved at the untimely death of our honored friend and employer, Mr. James D. Warren. We bear testimony to the fact that he was always kind and considerate in his treatment of us, and we, one and all, had reason to regard him as a kind, just, and consistent friend.</p><p>As an employer he had our fullest respect. We admired his many noble qualities and the justness of his dealings. To his family we offer our deepest sympathy at this the time of their great loss, and assure them that we too are mourners.</p><p>Mr. Warren&rsquo;s sterling qualities of heart and mind are too well known to the community at large to need extended eulogy at our hands, but it is at such a time as this that we can best appreciate his great worth and feel the deep loss that has fallen upon us.</p><p>He was fair and honorable to all. We deeply deplore his loss, and sincerely regret that death has severed the pleasant relations always sustained between him and those who entered his service.</p><p>ACTION OF FIFTH WARD REPUBLICANS.</p><p>At a meeting of the Fifth Ward Republican Committee last evening the following resolution was adopted:</p><p>The Fifth Ward Republican Committee desire to add expressions commemorative of the esteem and regard with which we have at all times looked upon James D. Warren. As a leading Republican in Wester New-York and especially in Erie County his counsel and advice, it has seemed to us, were such that they could be relied upon as being safe, prudent, and politic, and it was always with feelings of assurance and success that his wise counsel and advice were received. Truly the Republican party in the County of Erie has lost an able and staunch leader in the person of Mr. Warren. His private life, genial, whole-souled disposition are known to all who knew him, and those where were privileged to know him intimately can best testify to his honorable manhood and his deep anxiety for the success of his friends or anyone in whom he became interested, and to the value of his wisdom and counsel. We extremely regret his untimely death and our sympathy is with those who knew him better and those who loved him best.</p><p><strong>A Meeting of City Hall Officials.</strong></p><p>It was the unanimous opinion of the officials of the City and County Hall, irrespective of party, that a meeting should be held to take action on Mr. Warren’s death. It was decided to hold it at the Mayor’s office to-morrow morning at 11 o’clock.</p><p><strong>Feeling Among Republican Congressmen</strong></p><p><em>SPECIAL TO THE BUFFALO EXPRESS</em></p><p>Washington, Dec. 18.—Major Farquar and Col. J. B. Weber sent telegrams of condolence to the family of Mr. James D. Warren, on learning of that gentleman’s death this morning. Col Weber started to-night for Buffalo, where he expects to arrive at 8.35 o’clock to-morrow evening for the purpose of attending the funeral. Maj Farquar will not go. He has a great many matters of interest to his constituents to look after, with will occupy all his time from now on until after the recess.</p><p><strong>Regret at Lockport.</strong></p><p><em>SPECIAL TO THE BUFFALO EXPRESS</em></p><p>Lockport, Dec. 18.—The death of James D, Warren of Buffalo when announced here created a general feeling of sadness among the prominent Republicans. General regret that such a party leader should be taken away in his prime is expressed.</p></blockquote><figcaption>

Warren departed this life, Friday evening. The cause of death was inflammation of the bladder, his father having died from the same malady. Several hours before the end came, an operation was performed, to relieve a swelling near the groin. It was expected that he would improve after the operation, but an hour afterward he began to sink rapidly.</p><p>The history of the deceased was in many respects a remarkable one. Born on a farm in Bennington, N. Y., January 19, 1823, his parents early removed to Clarence, this county. His father kept the village store, and young Warren alternately worked on the farm and in the store. At the age of 19 he made a tour of the southern states. Returning to Clarence, his neighbors elected him to represent the town in the Board of Supervisors. He was re-elected several times, and in 1854 he was elected county treasurer. Afterward he was thrice elected clerk of the Board of Supervisors. In 1861, with Messrs. Joseph Wheeler and Joseph Candee, he purchased the <em>Commercial Advertiser.</em> The following year Mr. James N. Matthews succeeded Mr. Candee, and in 1864 Mr. Candee retired, the firm remaining as Matthews & Warren until 1877, when Mr. Matthews retired. Under Mr. Warren&rsquo;s able management the paper became one of the leader republican newspapers of the country, equally prosperous and influential. In 1880, Mr. Warren was delegate-at-large to the national republican convention. In 18885, he was a prominent candidate for governor, receiving 138 votes in the convention. He came near being chosen United States senator in place of Hon. W. M. Evarts. In October last Mr. Warren went to New York, and had an affecting interview with the late ex-President Arthur. When taking his leave of him Mr. Warren could not restrain his feelings, realizing that it would be the last time he would ever see him on earth. Arthur took his hand in both of his, exclaiming, with deep emotion: &ldquo;Warren, I love you, and always have.&rdquo;</p><p>Mr. Warren was twice married, his first wife having been Miss Laura, daughter of the late Geo. Love, by whom he had one son, Orsamus G. After her death, he married Miss Mary, daughter of the late Judge Mills, who, together with a son, Wm. C. and a daughter, Mrs. Isaac Bromley, Jr., survive.</p><p>Mr. Warren was prominent in many enterprises, and was popular with his friends, his employes and the public. His political opponents respected him. Scrupulously honest, genial and warm-hearted, Buffalo will deeply mourn his loss.</p><p>The funeral will take place from the family residence, 222 North street, to-morrow afternoon at 2.30 o&rsquo;clock. The burial will be at the convenience of the family.</p><p>ACTION OF THE BUFFALO PRESS</p><p>A special meeting of the Press club to take action on the death of Mr. James D. Warren, was held at the rooms of the club, over the Bank of Buffalo, last evening. There was a large attendance of members, as well as other representatives of the Buffalo press. Among those present were Hon. F. F. Fargo, Rev. Patrick Cronin, Matthias Rohr, N. E. Mack, Richmond C. Hill, Wm. McIntosh, J. Ambrose Butler, Leslie Thom, Arthur W. Austin, J. D. Kellos, E. L. Lawrence, Monte Cutler, Eugene Z. Fleury, George Ferris and others.</p><p>President McIntosh feelingly alluded to the object of the meeting, and on motion Rev. Father Cronin was called to preside.</p><p>Father Cronin spoke of Mr. Warren as on of Buffalo&rsquo;s foremost citizens. On such occasions as the present, he said, the tongue is very weak to speak what the heart so strongly feels. He was very profoundly impressed by Mr. Warren&rsquo;s death, and had hoped for many weeks for his recover. He compared him to a towering oak struck down by a bolt of lightning, and spoke of his energy, influence and enterprise. He often though and regarded him as a typical American—a man of simple tastes, strong convictions, a strong friend and an honorable foe. Like all our great men, he had the good fortune not to have been born to enervating fortune. He carved his own way by honorable means. He had no offensive mannerisms that repelled those lowlier than himself. He relations with the deceased were always of the most precious character.</p><p>Hon. Francis F. Fargo said Mr. Warren was no ordinary man. We do ourselves honor in seeking to honor him. Although Mr. Warren was not a journalist in the strictest sense, he was of publicist of the largest experience. He occupied a position in the front rank of journalists in this country and was known throughout the state and nation. His death is a public calamity. To be thus stricken down in his prime, is a terrible loss. His place will not be easily filled in Buffalo. Mr. Faro moved the appointment of a committee of five to draft resolutions, and Messrs. Fargo, McIntoch, Fleury, Mack and Rohr were appointed.</p><p>Mr. R. C. Hill said his experience with Mr. Warren had been most pleasant. He felt that he had lost a friend–one whom he had greatly respected. He thought the entire press, outside of the club, felt his loss was a great one to the profession and to the public. Mr. Warren exerted a peculiar and beneficial influence.</p><p>The committee reported the following memorial, which was unanimously adopted:</p><p>The death of James D. Warren, in the fullness and vigor of manhood, is an incalculable loss to the city, the state and the nation. His influence and usefulness were not limited to municipal locality, but were felt throughout the commonwealth, even extending to the boundaries of the union itself.</p><p>Cast in a large mould Mr. Warren instinctively took a broad and comprehensive view of affairs and was readily recognized by his fellows as a leader of men.

In society, business, and political affairs he occupied a place in the front rank and the place was not only occupied, but filled. His knowledge of men and affairs seemed intuitive. His judgment as unerring as is possible for human opinion to be, and his integrity was without a blemish. His private life was without reproach, and his death is an almost unbearable bereavement to his afflicted family.</p><p>The Press club, speaking for itself and the press generally, feels it an honor to place this brief testimonial upon the bier of one who has added lustre to the profession of which it is a representative.</p><p><em>Resolved,</em> That the members of this club will attend the obsequies of Mr. Warren in a body, and invite members of the press generally to join them.</p><p><em>Resolved,</em> That an engrossed copy of the foregoing, attested by the officers of the club, be presented to the family of the deceased.</p><p>A committee of arrangements was appointed, and the members of the press will meet at the Press club rooms at 1 P. M. to-morrow, and proceed in a body to the funeral. The meeting then adjourned.</p><p>The directors of White’s bank, of which Mr. Warren was president, the republican executive committee, and the employes of the <em>Commercial,</em> passed appropriate resolutions yesterday.</p></blockquote><figcaption>

The twelve o’clock edition will be served to all subscribers alike. This arrangement will enable all persons connected with the establishment to testify, in some small degree to the affectionate esteem in which they held their late employer by attending the funeral this afternoon.</p><p>Hoping and believing that all readers of the COMMERCIAL are friends of our dead chief we need not ask their kind indulgence at this hour. We give up today’s paper largely to expression of public and private grief elicited by Mr. WARREN’S untimely death. On this page are reproduced the local tributes; on the fourth page, those from abroad. During the past forty-eight hours a great number of telegrams and letters of condolence and sympathy have been received by Mr. WARREN’S family, from all parts of the state and from Washington. These messages are from warm personal friends and former political comrades. They all testify to the honor in which they held Mr. WARREN and their sense of the loss suffered by themselves by the party and by the state, in his death. These message are prized extremely by Mr. WARREN’S family: but, for the present at least, will not be made public.</p><p>To its exchanges throughout the state, the COMMERCIAL begs leave to say that their comments on Mr. WARREN’S taking-off are gratefully appreciated, and that if any are omitted in our extracts the fact is owing to irregularity in the mails or to accident.</p><p>Buffalo Sunday News.</p><p>The <em>Sunday News</em> can but add it mite to the testimony of hundreds of friends—private, business and political to the many admirable traits of the late JAMES D. WARREN. Unobtrusive in his private life, winning his friendships through the qualities of his nature, and not through seeking or advances, he manifest the same disposition in politics. He was recognized as a great power in local, state and national politics, but he showed no desire to thrust himself forward. Had he been spared to occupy a seat in the United States senate, where many desired to see him, his sterling honesty, strong common sense and financial ability would have been of great benefit to this country. But neither that nor any other public honor would have come to him at his own solicitation. The republican party in this section has lost its ablest and greatest leader, and one whom the lieutenants followed with more enthusiasm than is likely to be raised for any possible successor.</p><p>Buffalo Sunday Truth.</p><p>By this demise this community sustains a great loss, not only on account of the position he occupied and the influences he exercised, but also because of the example he set in his daily life of love and fidelity to his family, geniality to those associated with him in business and rugged honesty in all his public affairs. The high position he attained in the republican politics of the state was not due to personal ambition any more than the success of his newspaper, the COMMERCIAL ADVERTISER, and its accompanying printing establishment was the result of any positive genius or special training. From working on his father’s farm and trading in a country store he developed into a careful, judicious, reliable business man. He was unswervingly faithful to his friends, and the fact that changes on the staff of his newspaper were very few and far between testifies alike to their zeal and ability and his just appreciation thereof.</p><p>We most earnestly extend our sympathy to the family, and to all who very immediately feel the weight of this great bereavement.</p><p>Buffalo Times.</p><p>MR. WARREN was marked our for a leader of men; strong, self-reliant, generous even to his adversaries, just ever to his friends, he was one who invariably commanded the respect of others. He was three times supervisor and long a member of the republican state committee and a leader in the councils of his party.</p><p>In private life Mr. WARREN was a man of genial, pleasant manners and a general favorite. He was, in fine, a gentleman and one who held courageously and sternly to his own opinions.</p><p>The <em>Times</em> reiterates that the city and state have lost in Mr. WARREN an exponent of true and noble manhood, the republican party a leader, his employes a friend and his family a father. The sympathy of the community is with the stricken family.</p><p>From the Buffalo Free Press of the 18th.</p><p>The publisher of the COMMERCIAL ADVERTISER, JAMES D. WARREN, died yesterday in his 64th year, after a sickness of a few weeks’ duration from a hereditary affliction. The mourning over his death, which came rather unexpected, as his physicians had only lately given hopes for his recover, is in this city a universal one, and will also be felt in the larger circles, there the deceased, on account of his many excellent qualities, was held in the highest esteem. Here everybody knew him as a citizen of sterling worth, as an able and reliable business man, as a politician in the best sense of the word. In this, his latter capacity, he had the confidence of his party associates, the republicans, far over the limits of this state and could be proud of the friendship of the most eminent men in the country. The late ex-President Arthur, whom death took away a few weeks ago, being an intimate friend of his. Nobody did dare to dispute his party leadership in the city and country, whilst he was among us yet; for years he was the managing spirit of it and saw to its interests in the executive committee of the state and at the national conventions. Gifted with a rare talent of organization, he hardly ever made a mistake in selecting his political co-workers. To his friends he remained always true, upon his word everybody could rely–this explains his universal popularity. In the late years his name was often mentioned in connection with high offices, but it seemed as if he was unwilling to leave the sphere of activity so dear to him, for the COMMERCIAL ADVERTISER, a paper that in it present equipment has shown itself as a surpassing success, may as such be called a creation of his own.</p><p>The <em>Freie Prssse</em>, and with it the German republicans of the city and county, whilst deploring deeply the loss, which this community and the party endures through this death, shall forever honor the memory of him who has gone from us.</p><p>Translated from the Demokrat, December 18th.</p><p>By the death of Mr. JAMES D. WARREN, which occurred last evening, Buffalo has lost one of her most prominent citizens. The grave disease from which he suffered for a long time, from the outset, left little room for the hope of an eventual recovery; yet the favorable accounts recently received regarding his condition had the effect that the announcement of his death was a sudden and severe blow to his numerous friends.</p><p>For many years, MR. WARREN occupied one of the most conspicuous positions among the business men of our city, part owner and finally sole proprietor of the COMMERCIAL ADVERTISER. That paper for its growth and present prominent and influential place among the newspapers of the state is greatly indebted to MR. WARREN’S business sagacity and tact. The republican party of our state has lost in him one of its most distinguished leaders. The success which that party in recent years achieved in this section of the state, was largely due to the loyalty, zeal and skillful management of the deceased. A strict party ma, he was highly esteemed by his political opponents. In his business relations he distinguished himself by strict integrity and honorable dealing. He had few enemies and many friends and his memory will always be honored by those who knew him. To his afflicted family and co-workers in the large establishment of which he was the head, we express our heartfelt sympathy.</p></blockquote><figcaption>

WARREN.</p><p>ACTION OF VARIOUS ORGANIZATIONS.</p><p>Tributes of Affection and Respect.—A Medical History of the Case.—The Funeral this Afternoon.</p><p>The obsequies of the late JAMES D. WARREN, proprietor of the COMMERCIAL ADVERTISER, will be held at 2.30 o&rsquo;clock this afternoon at the family residence on North street. Owing to the sad occasion, only the first (noon) edition of the COMMERCIAL will be issued today, and the establishment will be closed this afternoon.</p><p>In view of the interest that has attached to the case of MR. WARREN, and to correct any misapprehensions that may exist, the COMMERCIAL publishes the following history of the case as dictated by Dr. John D. Hill, his attending physician:</p><p>THE HISTORY OF THE CASE.</p><p>MR. JAMES D. WARREN first consulted me on the 18th day of September, 1886, with such symptoms as he. MR. WARREN, generally called &ldquo;bilious,” and he asked that I should give him &ldquo;some medicine,” and 1 prescribed such medicine as I was in the habit of prescribing for him under like circumstances, and with such symptoms as he had frequently complained of: but without the usual beneficial result. Three or four days after, the same remedies were repeated and followed, in connection with doses of quinine, three times a day. In the meantime MR. WARREN in his own view and that of his physician, showed symptoms of gradual improvement. He was desirous to visit New York: he thought the visit would do him good; he had not been there since his management of the Blaine campaign; he was receiving letters from old political friends urging him to be in New York at the meeting of the state committee, and he went with my approval. He was there four or five days, but did not see me until a week had elapsed since my last interview with him. On his return he said he thought his trip had done him good: that he was feeling better than he was when he left Buffalo. Within a few days after his return, i.e. the 18th of October, he consulted me for several days in succession with symptoms of mild cystitis. These became daily more aggravated, though not enough so to interfere with his going to the office and the bank. On the 28th of October at my request he submitted to physical examination of the bladder and the prostate gland. This examination revealed acute inflammation of the prostate gland and neck of the bladder, which was accompanied from that time with acute physical suffering. At this period MR. WARREN gave up all attention to business; remained at home; did not take to his bed, but determined to devote himself to getting well. The usual vigorous treatment for relief of inflammation of this character was resorted to, and resulted in great relief to the patient and with apparent control of the disease; so much so that on the 2d of November he went to the polls and voted; it proved to be the last time of his leaving the house. At this time the patient evinced symptoms of what is generally called &ldquo;nervous prostration,"— the symptoms of return to usual health did not appear; on the contrary, extreme lassitude and manifest indifference to outside objects, lack of interest in what was going on about him; while there was great relief of painful symptoms, the symptoms of actual recovery did not exhibit themselves, as was reasonable to anticipate. There was an aggravation of these depressing mental and nervous symptoms up to the 25th of November, culminating in his first and the only chill that he had had up to that time—and prior to the day of his death. From the 25th and onward his symptoms grew more and more grave with occasional periods of slight amelioration. From this date he voided pus with the urine, with the exception of about two or three days. On the 7th or 8th of December a slight puffing in the femoral region was discovered, and was slightly tender to the touch. All this time, owing to the persistency of the depressing nervous symptoms referred to above, MR. WARREN was kept under the influence of antiseptic remedies, from the cessation of the acute inflammation of the prostate gland up to within a short time prior to decease. Up to within a period of twelve days prior to his death, MR. WARREN lost very little flesh, lost little of his rotundity, or his appearance of ruddy health and vigorous nutrition, and exhibited little or no loss of muscular force. It is the opinion of Dr. Hill, with full knowledge of the history of MR. WARREN’S case and from the developments in the autopsy, that MR. WARREN had not been in good general health for some time; that he was in a condition predisposed to acute inflammatory attacks, and without his usual power of recuperation; that the acute inflammation developed in the prostate gland resulted in the formation of pus, instead of resolution as was hoped and expected at the time. The pus there formed was taken up by absorbents and deposited in the supra-renal capsule of the left kidney, and there a pyogenic pocket formed and developed into a large abscess: and from this abscess arose those symptoms of nervous depression attributable, in the revelation of the autopsy, to a septic influence that was gradually poisoning MR. WARREN&rsquo;S entire system—this septic poison from this abscess, baffling the detection of his physicians, gradually sapped the foundations of MR. WARREN&rsquo;S vigorous constitution and eventually caused his death. MR. WARREN from the first feared that he was afflicted with inflammation of the bladder from which his father died. As the physician in both cases, and with the developments of an autopsy in each case, Dr. Hill finds that heredity was not a potent factor in JAMES D. WARREN’S case. In the father’s case was hypertrophy of the prostate gland with chronic inflammation of the bladder. In the case of the son was acute inflammation of the prostate gland, with formation of pus and septic intoxication. Mr. JAMES D. WARREN&rsquo;S fear that he would die as his father died, while not justified by the course of his own disease, was most unfortunate, and led from the first to great depression on his part.</p><p>The autopsy revealed that with the exception of such modifications as are above noted, all of MR. WARREN’S internal organs that wore examined were in a condition of such health as to warrant a belief that he should have been good for twenty years more except for the action of the septic poison already mentioned.</p><p>Concerning the report and opinion that have prevailed that Mr. WARREN died of hereditary disease, in the form of inflammation of the bladder, Dr. Burwell authorized the statement that &ldquo;in relation to the degree of inflammation of the bladder, from the autopsy of MR. WARREN it was found to be limited to the bas-fond of the bladder, and consisted of a circular spot of about an inch in diameter in which the mucus membrane was partially injected and partially ecchymosed— in and of itself not at all beyond the probability of complete recovery.”</p><p>ACTION OF THE REPUBLICAN LEAGUE.</p><p>A special meeting of the Buffalo Republican League was held on Saturday evening to take action on the death of Mr. WARREN. There was a large attendance.</p><p>President Ogden P. Letchworth, in stating the sad duty for which the League had met, fittingly referred to the great loss which city and state have suffered. He called upon, as better qualified to speak of the work and worth of MR. WARREN, Mr. S. C. Adams, an honorary member of the organization, and for many years a bosom friend of MR. WARREN. Mr. Adams was visibly affected, and as he spoke was so deeply moved that his voice was controlled with difficulty. His acquaintance with Mr. WARREN dated from 1852, when the latter represented Clarence in the board of supervisors, and he himself represented Collins. He had learned to love him as a brother.</p><p>Messrs. Seward A. Simons, Emory P. Close and William L. Marcy were appointed a committee to draft a suitable memorial, which was read by Mr. Simons as follows:</p><p>The Republican League has learned with deep sorrow of the death of JAMES D. WARREN, and unites in the genuine sentiment of public bereavement which is universal in this community.</p><p>MR. WARREN drew to himself with rare attractiveness a host of loyal friends, because he himself never betrayed one whose friendship he enjoyed. His name was a synonym of financial integrity, business worth, and untiring energy. His political life was one of conscientious fidelity and consistent devotion to a great party in whose principles he believed, the confidence of whose honored leaders he merited and received. His unswerving loyalty was marked by no personal ambition, his service was freely bestowed with no thought of recompense in position or power. His integrity of purpose never recognized a selfish end, he was a worthy leader, a trusted friend, a broad and liberal man, and a pure-minded citizen.</p><p>As a mark of respect to his memory, it is appropriate that the rooms of the League be draped in mourning for 50 days.</p><p>Mr. Simons moved the adoption of the resolution. Mr. Close, in seconding the motion, said:</p><p>In the funereal hush and shadow of, MR. WARREN’S death it is difficult to fitly speak. We are met here to pay honor and homage to the memory of a pure man, a distinguished citizen, and a brave leader. To me the announcement comes with the - oppressive weight of a deep personal loss. It was my privilege to know MR. WARREN intimately. During the presidential campaign of 1884, when MR. WARREN was chairman of the state committee, at his request I accompanied him to New York, and remained during the last two months of that active campaign, and had many opportunities of appreciating his administrative skill, his able leadership and unfaltering zeal. Strength, candor and loyalty were the leading characteristics of his nature. His strength was show in a firmness of purpose and conviction which could brook no opposition; in an energy and enterprise which commanded and achieved success. His candor was exhibited by his open and ingenuous utterances. His friends could always rely upon the assurances of his aid; his foes were promptly advised of an opposition which gave and asked no quarter. With him, the promise to the ear was never broken to the hope; his speech was ever the transparent vesture of his thought. His loyalty was demonstrated by an adherence to principle and to friend which never wavered, never doubted, never failed.</p><p>Mr. WARREN was the truly valiant man, who dared nothing but what he should; who feared nothing but what he ought. Noble in life, he is splendid in ashes, and will be eminent in the grave. He has gone from us forever. Nothing remains for us but indulge ourselves in that sweet anxiety which arises from the memory of a great affliction. He at last has joined the everlasting majority. He leaves behind him the recollections of</p><p>Only those actions of the just</p><p>Which smell sweet and blossom in the dust.</p><p>Mr. N. S Rosenau, in briefly paying his tribute of respect to MR. WARREN&rsquo;S memory, dwelt especially upon the great modesty of the man, who, while a leader, was contented and glad to remain in the ranks. He had made it his ambition to make famous the names and careers of other men. It was but fitting that the League should endeavor to keep green the memory of him who sought no honor for himself.</p><p>REMARKS OF MR. LAUGHLIN.</p><p>Mr. Chairman, and Brother Members of the League:</p><p>The sad event which calls us together so overwhelms me with sorrow that it is with feelings of the greatest hesitancy that I arise to add my humble tribute to the memory of the deceased, because I knew him well, and he was my friend.</p><p>Less than forty-eight hours ago we were gathered about the festive board, partaking of our annual banquet and enjoying to the fullest extent the festivities common to such an occasion. How changed is the scene tonight! The echo of friendly greeting, sweet music and song is scarcely hushed to our ears, the palative impressions left by that bounteous feast are still lingering on our lips, yet we find ourselves tonight called together to give some faint public expression to our feelings over the death of one who, in life, was most highly esteemed and respected, and who, in death, will be mourned, yet ever fondly mentioned by all who were fortunate as to have known him.</p><p>Death is so common, it is such a constant companion to mankind, that, with rare exceptions, we pay no more attention to it than to the accustomed change from day to night. We hear of the death of this or that individual in our community, we pick up our newspaper and read of the taking off of this or that prominent personage, but no impressions are left with us, because in the busy hum-drum and bustle of life we do not give such announcements more than passing notice.</p><p>But when death lays its icy hands on one who was great among men; when, as on this occasion, it walks into our midst and with its fatal arrow fells at our very feet one who was a giant among us in all that goes to make the perfect man, one who was loved and respected by a whole community, who had, by his marked ability as a political leader and his unselfish services to his chosen party, endeared himself to his state, we pause, with uncovered heads and welling hearts, in death&rsquo;s awful presence, pondering over the great mystery with which it shrouds the world.</p><p>Aside from the feelings of personal loss, what speculative thoughts come over us when we are brought face to face with death! Which of us will be the next to go? How soon will we, too, be called? What awaits us beyond the grave?</p><p>Death, at any me, no matter who nay be its victim, is more or less appalling, and leaves some degree of sorrow in its wake. In the whole range of human experience there is scarcely an occasion when the soul, bursting its earthly habitation, and, soaring upward, passes through the mysterious vail, which separates us from that future, the secrets of which have never yet been unfolded to our doubting, hoping, puzzled minds, but what some heart is saddened, some person made to mourn. It often makes itself manifest when and where least expected, and, indeed, as in the present instance, least welcome, and again it frequently delays its looked-for blow, when, to the disinterested observer, it would seem a great boon to many whom we see suffering about us, to Whom life must necessarily have become a burden by reason of long lingering disease, incurable disabilities or helpless old age.</p><p>Death gives no definite warning of its coming, yet we know that we must all sooner or later surrender to its icy embrace, and when it comes it ts unrelenting. It shows no partiality, it gives it victim no quarter,—grants him no time for preparation. Riches robes and all the luxuries of life receive no more respect from it than poverty and rags. Young and vigorous men like those assembled here, just entering on a career in life about the success of which there can be no question or shadow of doubts possessed in the fullest degree of every faculty, and with talents and accomplishments of the brightest promise—succumb to the fatal touch as easily, and almost as frequently, as those who, like him whose death we mourn tonight, have crossed the meridian of life marched down the western slope, and are there sojourning among the foot-hills in the complete enjoyment of the fruits of a life well spent.</p><p>There are, as I have intimated, occasions when death does not seem sad, particularly to those who are not immediately interested in the person who is taken away. When a man, after battling with the world for three or four score years, retires from the active duties of life, and looking back over the past can truthfully say, I have done all the good I could for mankind; I have, to the best of my ability, performed all the requirements of my position among men,’’—when such a man,with his faculties declining and his body growing weak and weary with age, finally slumbers in the peaceful swoon of death—that death is not sad. For experience has taught us that such is the proper ending of all earthly existence; and our own hopes and desires, the longing of our very souls, in spite of all our doubting, teach us that such an ending of our existence here is only the beginning of a much happier and more perfect existence hereafter—an existence in which we fervently hope to be forever united with the friends and loved ones who have gone before.</p><p>But when Divine Providences sees fit, as on this occasion, to tithe from our midst one who was still in the full vigor of all his faculties; one to whom so many still hoped to look for counsel, assistance and advice on matters of the greatest importance, politically and otherwise for many years to come; one who was surrounded by a loving and affectionate family, now so sadly bereaved by his untimely death; one who had, by his frugal industry, marked honesty, and honorable dealings with his fellow-men, accumulated a goodly portion of this world’s wealth, and was the happy possessor of an ideal home, and had everything about him to make his approaching old age happy and comfortable; who had, by his kindness of heart and his sociable disposition, endeared himself so universally to his friends and fellowmen,—such a taking-off is indeed sad, because it seems to us so untimely, and while we bow in sorrowful submission to the Power that thus takes him from us, we are, in our ignorance, almost tempted to question the wisdom of such a decree,</p><p>It was my pleasure and good fortune to know MR. WARREN intimately and well for the past six years, and when I come to speak of him personally words fail me, and become utterly inadequate to give true expression to the feelings that swell my heart. On his death I have lost one of the best friends I ever had, and I feel that that is gone from me forever which can never be replaced. He was about the only person I knew here when I came to Buffalo, and he always seemed to take great pleasure in introducing me among his friends and extending my acquaintance here whenever and whenever opportunity permitted it. I never asked him for a favor that he did not gladly grant, and I have always observed, as in my own case, that when he did any thing for any one there was nothing selfish in his action, always leaving the impression that it was a pleasure for him to extend any courtesy in his power.</p><p>He had one marked characteristic which I have observed, and that was that, with possibly very few exceptions, his strongest friendships were with men much younger than himself in years. Vigorous and robust in constitution, well preserved and free from dissipation, he felt young himself; and I know that many of the most pleasant hours of his life were spent in the company of his young friends. And it is not very improper to note that many of the most intimate of these young friends were democrats. For several years it has been customary with him on election day to give a dinner to about ten of his young friends in his own ward, and the boys have been accustomed to look forward with much pleasure to that annual dinner. It was my good fortune to be added to this list five or six years ago. Last election day, when we assembled at the accustomed place to partake of our election dinner, “Uncle Jim,” as the boys called him, was not there. Although none of us then realized that his illness which kept him from us would terminate fatally, yet no one who was present will ever forget the many kind feelings of sympathy and regret there expressed for him. Yes, he was pre-eminently a friend of the young men, and, outside of his immediate family circle, none will mourn his untimely death more than that circle of young men who have spent so many happy hours in his company.</p><p>As a political leader and counsellor in the ranks of the republican party he will be greatly missed. The republican party has lost in him one of its best and ablest men, and in Erie county as well as the whole State of New York will suffer for his death for many years to come.</p><p>During the arduous campaign of 1884, MR. WARREN&rsquo;S efforts as chairman of our state committee, Were untiring. He labored zealously both day and night during the whole campaign, and I have been often told by those in a position to know, that had his counsels been follow in more instances by the national committee the election would have resulted differently.</p><p>I, together with many of his friends, firmly believe that the great strain upon his constitution from his over work in that capacity sowed the seeds of disease which resulted in his dissolution. I believe that he cut off many years of his life in thus serving the republican party, and it is highly fitting that we, as young republicans on whom will now devolve a great share in that party work which he has been compelled by death to surrender, adopt the memorial just read as a faint token of the respect and esteem in which we held our deceased chieftain. The last act he ever did outside of his house was to vote the straight republican ticket last election day on being carried to the polls from the bed on which he breathed his last at half past eight o’clock last night.</p><p>We, as citizens of Buffalo, in common with all our fellow-citizens, deeply deplore his loss, because we realize that when his heart ceased to beat one of our foremost citizens was taken from us.</p><p>We, as republicans, together with all those of our party faith, while acknowledging and commemorating his great services to our party, feel that we have lost a leader whom we have followed to many victories, and who has always been true to the cause in which he was enlisted.</p><p>And we, who were his intimate friends, while sadly mourning his sudden departure from us, and realizing that we have lost a friend whose friendship cannot be replaced, find much consolation in the thought that there will ever be a fresh green spot in our memories recalling that pleasant friendship which death cannot efface. Of him we truly say that</p><p>&ldquo;Tho&rsquo; the brows of tomorrow be radiant and bright,</p><p>&ldquo;With love and with beauty, with life and with light,</p><p>&ldquo;The dead heart of yesterday, cold on the bier,</p><p>&ldquo;To the hearts that survive it, is ever more dear.&rdquo;</p><p>The memorial was unanimously adopted and on motion the house committee was instructed to drape the rooms of the leave in mourning for 30 days.</p><p>Upon motion a committee of active and honorary members, of which President Letchworth is chairman, was appointed to represent the league at the funeral of the deceased. All members of the league are invited to join the committee at the rooms of the league at 1.30 o&rsquo;clock this afternoon. With the chairman, the members of the committee are:</p><p>S.

Provost.</p><p>ACTION OF MEMBERS OF THE PRESS.</p><p>A largely-attended meeting of members of the press was held Saturday evening at the rooms of the Press Club, to take action on the death of MR. WARREN. President McIntosh called the meeting to order, briefly stating its purpose, and saying that it seemed proper though MR. WARREN had not been a member of that club, that the body take some action on his decease.</p><p>On motion of Mr. George Ferris, the Rev. Father Cronin was called to the chair, on assuming which he spoke as follows:</p><p>“GENTLEMEN—I should regard myself guilty pf culpable neglect in the performance of a solemn and melancholy duty did I fail to unite With you tonight in paying a suitable tribute to the memory of JAMES D. WARREN.</p><p>“Alas! that in moments such as these the tongue should be weak to express what the heart so strongly feels.</p><p>“I have been profoundly impressed with the announcement of MR. WARREN&rsquo;S death.</p><p>“Like a towering forest oak stricken by unexpected lightning from a summer sky, so comes the merciless arrow of the inevitable destroyer to one who indeed towered aloft above the crowd, not only by his commanding presence and superb physique, but by his strong personality and far reaching influence as well.</p><p>“Reflecting upon the all too untimely death of MR. WARREN—snatched away in the midst of his vigor, his usefulness, his power and his fame, who can help exclaiming to himself at least: And what is it all When all is done! It seems like the sudden dropping of the curtain and the quenching of the lights ere the play 1s half over.</p><p>“I am aware indeed how utterly vain is spoken praise to ‘the dull cold ear of death.’ But we owe it to the living, we owe it to our city, we owe it to the state, aye, We owe It to the nation to record our estimate of MR. WARREN&rsquo;S rare worth, ere his remains he consigned to their final rest,</p><p>“I shall not now dwell on the varied aspects of his long and useful career. That has been done today by kindly pens in our city press; and the story of the dead journalist&rsquo;s life will be rehearsed throughout the land.</p><p>“He was no child of enervating fortune. Like nearly all our great men, MR. WARREN sprang from the people; and all his manhood years were with the people and for them. And if those years were crowned with signal success—with large wealth and commanding influence—that success was achieved by resourceful brain, tireless labor and high endeavor. I have long regarded MR. WARREN as a typical American. Simple in his tastes, strong in convictions, vigorous in upholding them, he was warm as a friend and honorable as a foe; and while feeling himself the equal of any, he stooped to the lowly with an affability that won their hearts.</p><p>“Such is the Impression left upon me during my occasional intercourse with the distinguished dead.</p><p>“In his demise, Buffalo loses one of her foremost citizens, his party a sage in council and a hero in battle, his friends a man of whose regard they had reason to be proud, and the people of whatever condition, one whose sympathy was theirs and upon whose word they could rely.</p><p>“I am glad to state that my acquaintance with MR. WARREN was of the pleasantest character; and now that be is gone, I only wish I could pierce the desolation that enshrouds his lately happy home with some ray of sunshine, while joining you gentlemen in weaving for the memory of the illustrious dead a heart-wreath of immortelles.”</p><p>F. F. Fargo said he too had felt profoundly the shock of the sudden news which reached him that morning regarding the death of their distinguished friend and fellow citizen. MR. WARREN was no ordinary man, and in honoring him there were honoring themselves. Although not a journalist in the strictest sense of the word, MR. WARREN was a publicist of large experience and extended knowledge. After spending most of the years of his mature life at newspaper work he had come to occupy a proud position in the front rank, it might be said, among the journalists of the country. His influence and knowledge of men and affairs were not by any means limited to Buffalo. He was known and respected throughout the state and nation, and the death of such a man was a public calamity. Having thus been stricken down in the very prime of his manhood, his place in Buffalo would not be easily filled. The speaker moved the appointment of a committee of five to draft suitable resolutions. Carried, and the chair appointed Messrs. F. F. Fargo, William McIntosh, Norman E. Mack, Matthias Rohr, and Arthur W. Austin.</p><p>While the committee was making its report, Mr. R. C. Hill took occasion to add a few words, saying that his experiences with and reminiscences of MR. WARREN were most satisfactory. He deplored the loss of one so respected, and one who so ably represented the journalistic profession in Buffalo. He hoped a general expression of the entire press, irrespective of club membership, would be obtained, as he was sure the whole press united in regretting the loss of this respected member. P</p><p>Mr. Ambrose Butler took occasion to say that he was not personally acquainted with MR. WARREN, but his brother had known him well. He had just received a telegram from Mr. E. H, Butler saying that he deeply regretted the death of MR. WARREN, and united in paying a tribute to his memory.</p><p>Chairman Fargo then reported the following resolutions, which were unanimously adopted, as the sentiment of the meeting:</p><p>The death of JAMES D. WARREN in the fullness and vigor of manhood is an incalculable loss to the city, the state and the nation. His influence and usefulness were not limited to municipal locality, but were felt throughout the commonwealth, even extending to the boundaries of the Union itself.</p><p>Cast in a large mold, MR. WARREN instinctively took a broad and comprehensive view of affairs, and was readily recognized by his fellows as a leader of men. He was proverbially modest, never preferring nor urging his own claims or merits, but rather promoting those of others often less meritorious than his own.</p><p>MR. WARREN was a manly man. Always dignified and courteous, never trifling nor demeaning himself, he therefore commanded the respect of all classes of men. In society, business and political affairs he occupied a place in the front rank and the place was not only occupied but filled. His knowledge of men and affairs seemed intuitive, his judgment as unerring as is possible for human opinions to be, and his integrity was without a blemish. His private life was without a reproach and his death is an almost unbearable bereavement to his afflicted family.</p><p>The Press Club, speaking for itself and the press of the city of Buffalo, feel it an honor to place this brief testimonial upon the bier of one who has added lustre to the profession of which it is a representative.</p><p>Resolved, That the members of the club will attend the obsequies of MR. WARREN in a body, and invite members of the press generally to join them.</p><p>Resolved, That an engrossed copy of the foregoing, attested by the officers of the club, be presented to the family of the deceased.</p><p>The resolutions as first read were indicative only of regret on the part of the Press Club, but on motion of Mr. R. C. Hill, the words &ldquo;and the press of the city of Buffalo” were interpolated, and they were thus adopted.</p><p>Mr. Leslie Thom paid a tribute to the memory of MR. WARREN, saying that he deeply regretted the loss of a man whom he had known personally and who had made a deep and abiding impression upon the affairs of the city, while at the same time he took a melancholy pleasure in thus giving utterance to the regard for the deceased.</p><p>Mr. Matthias Rohr gave voice to the sentiments of respect concerning the loss to the community of a man who was so great a figure in it, and whom he had known so well.</p><p>Arthur W. Austin said the sentiments of the entire staff of the COMMERCIAL ADVERTISER had been so well set forth in a brief editorial contained in the paper of that evening, that any further words from him would be superfluous. They all felt they had lost a true, kind, steadfast friend, one who had always been considerate in his treatment of his employes, ever ready to overlook failings and prompt to commend what he deemed commendable.</p><p>Mr. Fargo moved that as the resolutions provided that the press should attend in a body, that a committee of arrangements be appointed by the chair to provide for this, and the following committee was named:</p><p>Messrs. F. F. Fargo, George Bleistein, George M. Hausauer, E. H. Butler, Eugene Fleury, Norman E. Mack.</p><p>The meeting then adjourned.</p><p>ACTION OF WHITE&rsquo;S BANK.</p><p>A meeting of the directors of White&rsquo;s Bank of Buffalo, of which MR. WARREN was president, was held on Saturday afternoon. The following memorial, presented by the Hon. Nelson K. Hopkins, was unanimously adopted.</p><p>We have heard with profound regret and sorrow of the death of the Hon. JAMES D.WARREN the President of this bank, with whom we have been pleasantly associated for many years. He was an able and accomplished man of business, a warm and devoted friend, and an agreeable companion. He has been called to many important and responsible positions in life, and he has filled them all with honor and credit.</p><p>Resolved, That in death of MR. WARREN this bank has lost a wise, honest and indefatigable officer, who has always had its success and prosperity at heart; that we individually have lost a valued friend, the bank a safe counselor, and this community a highly-esteemed and worthy citizen.</p><p>Resolved, That we extend to the family of the deceased our sympathy in its bereavement; that out of respect to his memory this bank be draped in mourning for thirty days, and that this board attend the funeral in a body.</p><p>Resolved, That these resolutions be entered in the minutes, and a copy he sent to the family of the deceased, and published in the daily papers of the city.</p><p>ACTION OF FIFTH WARD REPUBLICANS.</p><p>At a meeting of the Fifth ward republican committee Saturday evening the following resolution was adopted:</p><p>The Fifth ward republican committee desire to add expressions commemorative of the esteem and regard with which we have at all times looked upon JAMES D. WARREN. As a leading republican in Western New York, and especially in Erie county, his counsel and advice, it has seemed to us, were such that they could be relied upon as being safe, prudent, and politic, and it was always with feelings of assurance and success that his wise counsel and advice were received. Truly the republican party in the county of Erie has lost an able and staunch leader in the person of MR. WARREN. His private life, genial, whole-souled disposition are known to all who knew him, and those who were privileged to know him intimately can best testify to his honorable manhood and his deep anxiety for the success of his friends or anyone in whom he became interested, and to the value of his wisdom and counsel. We extremely regret his untimely death and our sympathy is with those who knew him better and those who loved him best.</p><p>ACTION OF CITY AND COUNTY OFFICIALS.</p><p>At a meeting of the officials of the City and County, irrespective of party, held at Mayor Becker’s office at 11 o&rsquo;clock today the following memorial and resolution was unanimously adopted:</p><p>We, the officials and employees of the city and county, were extremely grieved upon learning of the death of our esteemed fellow citizen JAMES D. WARREN; and moved by a common impulse and appreciation of the great loss thus sustained, have come together to express our sorrow and pay our humble tribute of respect to the distinguished dead.</p><p>By his breadth of intellect, his liberal views, his indefatigable enterprise and his untiring devotion to the welfare of our city for upwards of thirty years, he contributed largely to its growth and prosperity.</p><p>By his truthfulness, honesty, integrity and superior business ability and tact, he was remarkably successful, winning the confidence and esteem of all, and was justly regarded as the soul of commercial honor.</p><p>By his noble character and high moral standard, combined with rare talent, he did inestimable good in elevating the character and tone of the Press, and by furnishing our people with a pure and able journal.</p><p>Endowed with an affable manner, a generous heart, and an affection for his friends, by the aid of his almost perfect knowledge of human nature, coupled with a superior judgment and strong political conviction, he early became a leader in his party, and was long prominent in its councils throughout the state and nation.</p><p>His noble character and upright life which were crowned with deserved success, have met the approval of multitude of bereaved fellow-countrymen, and are worthy the emulation of all.</p><p>Resolved, That this testimonial be furnished the Press, and an engrossed copy be transmitted to the grief-stricken family, and that we attend the funeral.</p><p>LETTERS OF CONDOLENCE.</p><p>During the past forty-eight hours letters of condolence have been received from the following friends of the deceased: Ex-senator Roscoe Conkling, ex-Governor A.

In the lower front parlor to the west were gathered many of Mr. Warren’s old friends and acquaintances, including some of the most prominent citizens of Buffalo. Seated in a room just in the rear of the hall were Mayor Becker and a delegation of officials of the city and county, and the employees of the <em>Commercial</em>.

Hopkins, the Hon. James M. Humphrey, Mr. John L. Williams, Mr. Henry W. Box, the Hon. Solomon Scheu, Mr. Robert Keating.</p><p><strong>THE REV. DR. SMITH’S ADDRESS.</strong></p><p>The officiating clergyman was the Rev, Dr. T. Ralston Smith, pastor of Westminster Presbyterian Church, who read the service of his church as a preface to his remarks, There was no music. He spoke as follows:</p><p>The holy offices of the Church speak to our hearts the words that we most need to hear. The utterances of man are as nothing in the presence of God&rsquo;s voice of pity and love. It is a still, small voice, but it can be heard by the listening soul amidst the wildest raging of the tempest: “Be silent, and know that I am God.” We do know it in the manifestations of His power. Shall we not also know in the sweet experience of the Fatherly help and consolation?</p><p>When such a man as James D. Warren is suddenly removed from a large sphere of activity and influence, it is difficult to avoid referring, even in a service which is meant for the comfort of a sorrowing home, to the place he has filled and the work he has done. I am specially restricted, however, by the sacred wishes of his family, to the fewest possible and the simplest words. His eulogy has already been written. His life has been open to the inspection of a generation. The impress of his work is too deep to be lost or forgotten soon. The solemnities of this hour are rather for the heart of affection, which looks at things commonly secluded from the observation of the world, and worth more to the memory of the loving, than all the victories and distinctions of public life. It is the husband and father who is mourned and wept for, even more than the man who formed opinion and disciplined others for work and made his mark on the history of the times.</p><p>Yet even in the brief word allowed me may I say with no purpose of mere eulogy that our departed friend was a man who has filled, and filled well, a position of honorable elevation, of weighty cares and large responsibilities. He entered public life at a comparatively early age and has been devoted to its interests ever since. From such a life conflicts are inseparable. But he bore his part in them manfully, so that even those who were in form his antagonists, but at heart his friends, are foremost in paying respectful and affectionate tributes to his memory and to the marked achievements of his busy career. That he found satisfaction in his chosen calling there can be no question. But it is doubtless true that honor and the care that comes with it, were finally pressed upon him beyond the point of his desire; and, we have sad reason for fearing now, beyond the power of even his splendid physique to endure. But where he served, he served diligently and well. A man of few words and those few words plain, quiet, and forcible—a man of pronounced executive ability—a man adapted to lead, and to inspire where he led, he has been a marked figure not only in the city which he loved but in the State and even the nation. His loss in the public sphere will be felt, has been felt most deeply, already. Those who were with him and those who differed with him, vie in their testimonials of respect and honor.</p><p>Possibly, however, Mr. Warren’s ambition was gratified even more by his success as a newspaper man and as the conductor of a business which has been identified for years with his name not only, his actual and efficient personality. If he had chosen his monument, I think he would have chosen this. His mind, his force, his enthusiasm, his love, were incorporated in it. He thus became the architect of an edifice whose materials and proportions clearly manifest to us what he was. It is no wonder if he felt an honest pride in his achievement. But it was a pride which endear men to those who share their toil. One of the beautiful things which cast a mellow light upon this hour of sorrow is the voluntary testimony of those in his employ, that they can recall no harsh, or overbearing, or unjust word in all the course of their relations with him. It is sweet to think that despite all the temptations of public life, those who knew Mr. Warren best think of him to-day chiefly as the tried, the true, and the trustworthy friend.</p><p>But there is something to be said that rises higher even than the encomiums of those who knew him in this outer life. We are in danger of supposing that men of broad public relations have little time, possibly little inclination, for the endearments and quiet enjoyments of home. But this certainly was not true of our lamented friend. He was a devoted husband and father. He magnified the domestic life. He was loved in his home as the true man should be and will be loved. Happy in these relations and blessed by Providence with the means of making his home attractive and beautiful, I cannot doubt that he returned to its sweet retirement, from every other scene, however fascinating, with the keenest relish for the love and sympathy which always awaited him here. If in business he occupied a high place, if in public affairs he wielded wide influence, if in friendship he was liberal and helpful, the highest throne he occupied was the throne built in the loving hearts that most deeply mourn for him to-day.</p><p>It is only a few short weeks since he took by the hand a distinguished citizen to whose fortunes he had steadfastly been allied and bade him a last and tender farewell. He left him with the words ringing in his ears, “Mr. Warren, I love you!” In a little while that friend passed beyond the reach and need of earthly honor. Who could have supposed that the strong man who stood by that feeble form would follow in the same journey so soon? And this involves even a more sorrowful and tearful leave-taking. Wife and child, brothers and sisters, forgetting the outer life, think this moment only of the dear inmate of the home, of the man on whom they leaned, whose heart they knew, whose higher qualities were reserved for their enjoyment, whose place as husband and father and brother must forever remain unfilled.</p><p>There is an element of mystery in the bereavement before us. We can only bow the head in solemn and waiting reverence. Why this friend in the very prime of life, in the fullness of his powers, and at the time when he never seemed to be more needed in the household circle, should suddenly be smitten down, is a question which we can leave only to the sovereign wisdom of our Heavenly Father. If our own children cannot search our thoughts, how can we search God’s? Yet we expect our children to be docile and submissive, to have faith in us, to be assured of our love. Shall we have less trust in the infinite wisdom and the infinite goodness?” I know the weakness of human hearts, especially in crushing sorrow. I know the temptations to doubt and mourning. I know how the question arises “Why, why, must this be so?” And it is a question which we cannot answer. But we can stretch forth our hands to God and humbly say, “Is is best because Thou doest it. We cannot understand the way by which Thou dost lead us, but it is Thy way, and Thou art love.” The lesson of resignation is a hard lesson to learn, but it is a sweet one. We have to rise up to great heights of confidence before we can say, “The Lord gave and the Lord hath taken away; blessed be the name of the Lord.” But his own hand can lift us to those heights, and His own grace can put these patient and trustful words upon our lips and in our hearts.</p><p>These sorrowing ones to-day can find a wondrously large infusion of sweetness in the bitter elements of the cup they drink. They can remember the beauty of the home life with its unbroken confidences. They can remember how earthly honors and duties never eclipsed the light of domestic love. They can recall heroic patience in suffering, thoughtfulness for others, even during paroxysms of pain, the gentle ministries of affection which they were permitted to exercise and the death at last like sleep to a tired child. Evermore can they think of the promised sympathy of Him who is so sweetly described as the Judge of the widow and the Father of the fatherless; of the sympathizing Jesus, who, as we are reminded by the season, coming into our nature through the lowliness and helplessness of childhood, partook of sorrow beyond measure of our humanity, and knows there is no night so dark but the light of Christ can brighten it into day. There is no sorrow so deep but that divine comfort can turn it into peace and joy. There are no tears that the hand of heavenly love cannot wipe away.</p><p>May God’s peace come into these sorrow-stricken bosoms. May the arm of Jesus be felt in its strong embrace of these forms stunned and staggering beneath the force of this weighty blow.</p><p>The family of the deceased, the staff of the <em>Commercial</em>, Senator Miller, and other distinguished friends of Mr. Warren from out of town followed the remains to Forest Lawn, where the body was placed in the receiving vault to await interment. The exercises at the cemetery were very brief, simple, and impressive.</p><p>Where the body will finally be interred has not been decided, though it is likely to be at Clarence, Mr. Warren&rsquo;s old home, and the resting place of the mortal remains of his father.</p><p><strong>Action of City Hall Officials.</strong></p><p>A meeting of the officials and others employed at the City and County Hall was held yesterday morning at 11 o&rsquo;clock to take action on the death of Mr. James D. Warren. There were present Mayor Becker, Judges Tites and L. L. Lewis, Surrogate Stern, District-Attorney Hatch, Superintendent-of-Schools Assessors Murphy and Mock, Street-Commissioner Martin, Auditor Smith, Comptroller Barnard, Deputy-Comptroller Albro, Supt. Knapp of the Water Department, Healthy-Physician Briggs, Ald. White, dl Roesch, McMaster, and Kennedy, Keeper Moest of the Almshouse, Keeper Stickney of the Penitentiary, County-Treasurer Esser, City-Treasurer Carmichael, Sheriff Gilbert, Coroners Henry and Durney, Gen. Rogers, County-Clerk Orr, Water Commissioners Ryan and Reichert, City-Clerk Delaney, Police-Commissioners Crissy and Newell, Corporation-Counsel Worthington, City-Attorney Laughlin, Chairman Smither of the Board of Supervisors and others.</p><p>Mayor Becker, in assuming the chair, said he had known Mr. Warren for 40 years, and had entertained a warm friendship for him. On motion he appointed as a committee to draft a suitable memorial, Messrs, Laughlin, Crooker, Lewis, Titus, and Esser, The memorial was read by Mr. Laughlin and was unanimously adopted as follows :</p><p>We, the officials and others employed at the City and County Hall, were extremely grieved on learning of the death of our esteemed fellow-citizen, James D. Warren, and, moved by a common impulse and appreciation of a great loss thus sustained, have come together to express our sorrow and pay our humble tribute of respect to the distinguished dead.</p><p>By his breadth and intellect, his liberal views, his indefatigable enterprise, and his untiring devotion to the welfare of our city for upwards of 30 years he contributed largely to its growth and prosperity.</p><p>By his truthfulness, honesty, integrity, and superior business ability and tact he was remarkably successful, winning the confidence and esteem of all, and was justly regarded as the soul of commercial honor. By his high moral standard, combined with rare talent, he did inestimable good in elevating the character and tone of the press and by furnishing our people with a pure and able journal.</p><p>Endowed with an affable manner, a generous heart, and an affection for his friends, by the aid of his almost perfect knowledge of human nature, coupled with a superior judgement and strong political conviction, he became a leader in his party and was long prominent in its councils throughout the State and Nation.</p><p>His noble character and upright life, which were crowned with deserved success, have met the approval of a multitude of his bereaved fellow-countrymen and are worthy the emulation of all.</p><p><em>Resolved</em>, That this testimonial be furnished the press and an engrossed copy be transmitted to the grief-stricken family, and that we attend the funeral.</p><p>Judge Lewis paid a warm tribute to the memory of the departed. He said he had known him intimately ever since Mr. Warren came to the city in 1854. He entertained a very warm regard for him, and considered his death a great personal loss. Mr. Warren was always true to his work. He always unselfishly placed the interests of others before his own in political preferment, and those who had political intercourse with him knew they could place implicit confidence in whatever he said, and knew just what position he took. Candor, frankness, and open-heartedness were traits that made him a model among men.</p><p>District-Attorney Hatch spoke as follows:</p><p>In the course of nature such scenes as we are now witnessing must often occur. We may speculate much or little over the cause of death. We may assign reason why life should have been prolonged in a given case. We may question the skill of physicians. We may rebel and doubt even the justice of God; but to all of us comes the dread messenger, and neither speculation, skill, nor rebellion, suffices to drive him away.</p><p>I stand to-day by the open grave of my friend, and am consoled only by the knowledge, common to all, that he died as a man should die, with honors thick upon him, taking with him the love of friends, conscious of his own rectitude, commanding the respect of his enemies. This is no ordinary man we bury this day. Living, he was our first citizen. There more more men who knew him and paid homage to his unostentatious greatness than to any other in our city, and I can truthfully add in our State. It has been truthfully said that Mr. Warren was a leader of man. He was also a leader of measures. In all my intercourse with him I found him to be one of the best listeners I ever knew, ready at all times to receive suggestions, to hear all one had to say, and I think if the suggestion was good his ready comprehension accepted it, but he reserved to himself the right of final judgement. And this I found to be true, great or small. When once he had reach a conclusion, it was usually acceptable. He had no dogmatic assertion about him, nor offensive manner, nor much gift of language to enforce his views, nevertheless no one failed of understanding his position and of knowing his reason for it. He was no half-way man. While there were a hundred and one things and persons that he never troubled himself about, although others persistently said he did, yet when he did interest himself all could know of it, and also where he stood and what interest he was for. So strong was he as a leader of measures and of men in this State, that had his desire, if he had one, been made known from his sick bed, it would have had an undoubted influence on shaping the destiny of the State in the Senate of the United States. Could this power come to one save he were made upon a broad gauge—a great man? The princely property he left behind, earned by himself, is its own testimonial to his capacity as a business man.</p><p>But there was a tenderer relation which he occupied than what has been said would seem to imply. He gathered his friends about him, and no act or word of his ever did aught but contribute to their happiness. I think he was at all times ready to meet the highest or the lowest. No power of wealth or station ever awed him, no arrogance ever obtruded itself upon his lowliest friend. He had a gracious temper. Who ever saw his equipoise disturbed? I doubt if his friends ever saw him disturbed to what is called a loss of temper; he often felt wronged, and so expressed himself, but as for getting mad as commonly accepted, he was as far from it as a howling blast is from balmy summer air.</p><p>There was one power possessed by our dead friend with which we rarely meet. I wish I could tell it better than I shall. Between himself and his two sons there existed a confidence and affection which is rarely met with. It was a case of mutual confidence always maintained. The roots of affection usually reach downward from the parent to the child. Warm, constant companionship producing affections spreads its roots in all directions, including the heart. That such was the relation between Mr. Warren and his sons no one who knew them could help observing. He made his companionship acceptable in the highest and best sense to them; one never ashamed that his act should be known to the other. To my mind this is the highest and best possible relation which can exist to-day. The sons mourn the loss not only of an illustrious father, but of an illustrious friend and companion.</p><p>I can pay no higher tribute to James D. Warren. I loved him as a friend. We did not misunderstand each other. I shall always recollect that this day from the face of men to [unclear] the remains of a noble man.</p><p>Judge Titus said he had not known Mr. Warren as intimately as some of those present, but from the first day of their acquaintance he had learned to admire the fine qualities of the man. Mr. I. O. Crissy also eloquently eulogized the worth and character of the deceased leader.</p><p>The meeting adjourned at noon to attend the funeral.</p><p><strong>Action of the Common Council.</strong></p><p>Directly after roll call in Common Council yesterday the following preamble and resolution of respect relative to the death of James D. Warren were introduced by Ald. Rano and unanimously adopted:</p><p><em>Whereas</em>, In the death of James D. Warren the members of the Common Council of the City of Buffalo recognize the loss of a citizen to whom the city is greatly indebted for its rapid growth and its increasing prosperity. Watchful of its interests and quick to detect what would make for its advancement, his advice was as helpful as it was unselfish. He belonged to no ward; He spoke for no class. His active, sympathetic and liberal views made him pre-eminently a constituent of each member of this body. During a long and eventful business life, made more conspicuous by his connection with the press, it is difficult to recall a word written or spoken which did not breathe a loyalty to the city of his adoption, born of a desire to make it a city of wealth and progress, of happy homes, of contented people, and of good government inexpensively and honestly administered.</p><p><em>Resolved</em>, That this expression of our estimate of his services and character be spread upon the minutes, and an engrossed copy presented to the family of the deceased.</p><p><strong>Action of the Veteran Legion.</strong></p><p>The Union Veteran Legion met last evening and appointed Messrs. A. W. Bishop, Anselm J. Smith, and John S. Robertson a committee to draft a memorial on the death of James D. Warren, which they did as follows:</p><p>The Union Veteran Legion of Erie County, of which he was an honorary member, have experienced, like this community at large, a great loss in the death of James D. Warren. A self-made man whose struggles in early life were typical of a prominent trait in American civilization, he gradually advanced to the front in financial success; and in political life, while singularly free from personal ambition, he nevertheless impressed his individual power with unusual force upon party action and party methods. Always clear and direct in the preservation of what he believed to be correct, and the proper thing to be done in any emergency, whatever that emergency might be, his loss will be most keenly felt by his old associates, who must now wear the mantle the he so adorned and so dignified.</p><p>The Republican party, not only locally but throughout the State, has lost one of its strongest pillars—a man as prompt in action as wise in council, and one whose judgment, had it been deferred to on one specially memorable occasion, would have saved the party from a national defeat. As the world goes his life was a most decided success, and younger men can look back upon it with encouragement not only, but realizing that in it there is for them a stimulus for their own advancement and their own prosperity. Lives are valuable in the lessons they teach, and the legacy that Mr. Warren has left in this regard cannot fail of creating a profound impression, in this city especially, where he was so well known and so highly respected.</p><p>With their fellow citizens the members of this Legion unite in a common sorrow, and they extend to the bereaved family their most profound and heartfelt sympathy.</p></blockquote><figcaption>

WARREN.</p><p>FUNERAL SERVICES HELD YESTERDAY AFTERNOON.</p><p>Address by the Rev. Dr. Smith.—Further Memorial Tributes.</p><p>The funeral services of the late MR. JAMES D. WARREN were held yesterday afternoon at the family residence on North street, and were simple and unostentatious in their character. The attendance was very large, including many prominent citizens and old personal friends of the deceased, besides public officials and others. The remains reposed in a solid cedar casket, covered with fine black broadcloth, concave top, and ornamented with a silk cord that extended around it, with tassels at each end. It was lined with pleated satin richly trimmed and had oxydized silver extension bar and end handles. A solid silver plate bore the following inscription:</p><p>JAMES D. WARREN</p><p>BORN, JAN. 19, 1823.</p><p>DIED, DEC. 17, 1886.</p><p>The floral tributes were few in number, in accordance with the wishes of the family, and including two offering from employes of the COMMERCIAL ADVERTISER establishment, and a wreath from the carrier-boys.</p><p>The portrait of the late Ex-President Chester A. Arthur was draped with smilax. In this connection is it proper to state, that MR. WARREN’S physicians, fearing the depressing effect of the sad news, advised that he be not informed of the ex-president’s death, and he left the world without knowing that his distinguished friend had passed away.</p><p>Among those present at the obsequies from out of town were United States Senator Warner Miller, Congressman John B. Weber, the Hon. Andrew S. Draper, state superintendent of education; ex-Congressman James S. Smart, the Hon. Charles W. Hackett, chairman of the executive committee of the republican state committee; John A. Sleicher, editor of the <em>Albany Journal;</em> the Hon. Carroll Whittaker, Saugerties, N. Y.; the Hon. John M. Davy, Rochester; Willard A. Cobb, editor of the <em>Lockport Journal;</em> the Hon. Richard Crowley, Lockport, O. W. Cutler of the <em>Lockport Union;</em> Assemblyman Peter A. Porter, Niagara Falls; H. H. Warner, Rochester; Senator T. Ellsworth, Lockport; Charles E. Johnson, Philadelphia; Henry Abel, formerly of Governor Cornell’s staff; ex-Internal Revenue Collector Pierce of Canandaigua, and Dr. James of Lancaster.</p><p>From this city and vicinity there were representatives of all the political organizations, the Cleveland Democracy sending a delegation to be present along with similar delegations from the republican bodies. The Republican League, the Buffalo Press club, the city and county hall officials were well represented. Among those observed in the throng were Mayor Becker, the Hon. James O. Putnam, the Hon. E. G. Spaulding, the Hon. Daniel N. Lockwood, Charles W. Goodyear, the Hon. E. W. Hatch, George C. Green, the Hon. D. H. McMillan, Isaac M. Schermerhorn, the Hon. Albert Haight, George Bleistein, Edwin Fleming, the Rev. Patrick Cronin, Dr. J. D. Hill, Dr. R. V. Pierce, Dr. A. H. Briggs, Dr. Charles Ring, George Dunbar, E. P. Hays, Ogden P. Letchworth, Herbert P. Bissell, Herman Hennig, W. F. Mackey, George Bell, E. H. Tuthill, Corporation Counsel Worthington, H. S. Thayer, D. J. Kenefick, Anselm J. Smith, R. R. Hefford, F. F. Fargo, Frank A. Sears, C. Weyland, John Otto, Merritt Nichols, the Rev. Dr. Hubbell, the Rev. Oliver J. Booth, J. Adam Lautz, County Clerk Orr, Assemblyman Edward Gallagher and many others.</p><p>The officiating clergyman was the Rev. T. Ralston Smith, D. D., pastor of Westminster Presybterian church, who delivered the following funeral address:</p><p>The holy offices of the church speak to our hearts the words that we most need to hear. The utterances of man are as nothing in the presence of God’s voice of pity and lover. It is a still, small voice, but it can be heard by the listening soul amidst the wildest raging of the tempest, “Be silent, and know that I am God.” We do know it, in the manifestation of His power. Shall we not also know it, in the sweet experience of his Fatherly help and consolation.</p><p>When such a man as JAMES D. WARREN is suddenly removed from a large sphere of activity and influence, it is difficult to avoid referring, even in a service which is meant only fro the comfort of a sorrowing home, to the place he has filled and the work he has done. I am specially restricted, however, by the sacred wishes of his family, to the fewest possible and the simplest words. His eulogy has already been written. His life has been open to the inspection of a generation. The impress of his work is too deep to be lost or forgotten soon. The solemnities of this hour are rather for the heart of affection, which looks at things commonly secluded from the observation of the world, and worth more, to the memory of the loving, than all the victories and distinctions of public life. It is the husband and father who is mourned and wept for, even more than the man who has formed opinion and disciplined others for work, and made his mark on the history of the times.</p><p>Yet even in the brief words allowed me, may I say, with no purpose of mere eulogy, that our departed friend was a man who has filled, and filled well, a position of honorable elevation, of weighty cares and large responsibilities. He entered political life at a comparatively early age, and has been devoted to its interests ever since. From such a life conflicts are inseparable. But he bore his part in them manfully, so that even those who were in form his antagonists, but at heart his friends, are foremost in paying respectful and affectionate tribute to his memory, and to the marked achievements of his busy career. That he found satisfaction in his chosen calling there can be no question. But it is doubtless true that honor, and the care that comes with it, were finally pressed upon him beyond the point of his desire; and we have sad reason for fearing now, beyond the power of even his splendid physique to endure. But where he served he served diligently and well. A man of few words, and those words plain, direct and forcible, a man of pronounced executive ability—a man adapted to lead, and to inspire where he led, he has been a marked figure not only in the city in which he lived, but in the state, and even in the nation. His loss, in this public sphere, will be felt, has been felt most deeply, already. Those who were with him and those who differed with him, vie in their testimonials of respect and honor.</p><p>Possibly, however, Mr. WARREN’S ambition was gratified even more by his success as a newspaper man, and as the conductor of a business which has been identified for years with his name not only, but his actual and efficient personality. If he had chosen his monument, I think he should have chosen this. His mind, his force, his enthusiasm, his love, were incorporated in it. He thus became the architect of an edifice whose materials and proportions clearly manifest to us what he was. It is no wonder if he felt and honest price in his achievements. But it was a pride which did not suffocate those greater feelings which endear mend to those who share their toil. One of the beautiful things which casts a mellow light upon this hour of sorrow, is voluntary testimony of those in his employ that they can recall no harsh, or overbearing, or unjust word, in all the course of their relations with him. It is sweet to think, that despite all the temptations of a public life, those who knew Mr. WARREN best, think of him today chiefly as the tried, the true, and the trustworthy friend. But there is something to be said that rises higher even than the encomiums of those who know him in this outer life. We are in danger of supposing that men of broad public relations have little time, possibly little inclination, for the endearments and quiet enjoyments of home. But this certainly was not true of our own lamented friend. He magnified the domestic life. He was loved in his home as the true man should be and will be loved. Happy in these relations and blessed by Providence with the means of making his home attractive and beautiful, I cannot doubt that he turned to its sweet retirement, from every other scene, however, fascinating, with the keenest relish for the love and sympathy which always awaited him here. If in business he occupied a high place, if in public affairs he wielded a wide influence, if in friendship he was liberal and helpful, the highest throne he occupied was the throne he built in the loving hearts that most deeply mourn for him today.</p><p>It is only a few short weeks since he took by the hand a distinguished citizen to whose fortunes he had steadfastly been allied, and bade him a last and tender farewell. He left him with the words ringing in his ears, “Mr. WARREN, I love you.” In a little while that friend passed beyond the reach and need of earthly honor. Who could have supposed that the strong man who stood by that feeble form would follow in the same journey so soon? And this involves even a more sorrowful and tearful leave-taking. Wife and children, brothers and sisters, forgetting the outer life, think, this moment only of the dear inmate of the home, of the man on whom they leaned, whose heart they knew, whose higher qualities were reserved for enjoyment, whose place as husband, and father, and brother, must forever remain unfilled.</p><p>There is an element of mystery in the bereavement before which we can only bow the head in solemn and waiting reverence. Why this friend, in the very prime of life, in the fullness of his power, and at a time when he never seemed to be more needed in the household circle, should suddenly be smitten down, is a question which we can only leave to the sovereign wisdom of our Heavenly Father. If our own children cannot search our thoughts, how can we search God’s? Yet we expect our children to be docile and submissive, to have faith in us, to be assured of our love. Shall we have less trust in the infinite wisdom and the infinite goodness? I know the weakness of human hearts, especially in crushing sorry. I know the temptations to doubt and murmuring. I know how the question rises, why, why, must this be so? And it is a question which we cannot answer. But we can stretch forth our hands to God and humbly say: “It is best, because thou doest it. We cannot understand the way by which thou dost lead us; but it is thy way, and thou art love.” The lesson of resignation is a hard lesson to learn, but it is a sweet one. We have to rise up to great heights of confidence before we can say, “the Lord gave, and the Lord hath taken away; blessed be the name of the Lord.” But his own hand can lift us to these heights, and his own grace can put these patient and trustful words upon our lips and in our hearts.</p><p>These sorrowing ones today can find a wondrously large infusion of sweetness in the bitter elements of the cup they drink. They can remember the beauty of the home life with its unbroken confidences. They can remember how earthly honors and duties never eclipsed the light of domestic love. They can recall heroic patience in suffering, thoughtfulness for others even during the paroxysms of pain, the gentle ministries of affection which they were permitted to exercise, and the death at last coming like sleep to a tired child. Even more, they can think of the promised sympathy of Him who is so sweetly described as the judge of the widow and the father of the fatherless; of the sympathizing Jesus, who, as we are reminded by the season, coming into our nature through the comeliness and helplessness of childhood, partook of sorrow beyond the measure of our humanity, and know how to sympathize with every burdened and bleeding heart.</p><p>May God’s peace come into these sorrow-stricken bosoms; may the arm of Jesus be felt in it strong embrace of these forms stunned and staggering beneath the force of this weight blow. There is no night so dark but the light of Christ can brighten it into day. There is no sorrow so deep but that divine comfort can burn it into peace and joy. There are no tears that the hand of heavenly love cannot wipe away.</p><p>At the conclusion of the services the casket was borne to the hearse. The honorary pall bearers were: Hon. Chas. Daniels, General R. L. Howard, Hon. N. K. Hopkins, Hon. J. M. Humphrey, John L. Williams, Henry W. Box, Hon. Solomon Scheu, Robert Keating.</p><p>The following named gentlemen were the bearers:</p><p>James A. Roberts, George Urban, Jr., Col. John Byrne, Judge George A. Lewis, Hon. Jacob Stern, Henry C. French, William E. Clark, William B. Sirret.</p><p>The long line of carriages then started for Forest Lawn. The members of the family were followed by a few personal friends and members of the COMMERCIAL staff.</p><p>The remains were deposited temporarily in the receiving vault. Prayer was offered by the Rev. Oliver J. Booth, and the committal sentences were read by the Rev. Dr. Smith.</p><p>THE TRIBUTE OF THE OFFICIALS</p><p>At the meeting of the city and county officials at the Mayor’s office yesterday to take action on the death of Mr. WARREN, Judge-elect Edward W. Hatch spoke as follows:</p><p>In the course of nature, such scenes as we are now witnessing must often occur. We may speculate much or little over the cause of death. We may assign reason why life should have been prolonged in a given case. We may question the skill of physicians. We may rebel and doubt eve the justice of God; but to all of us comes the dread messenger, and neither speculation, skill or rebellion suffices to drive him away. I stand today by the open grave of my friend, and am consoled only by the knowledge, common to all, that he died as a man should die, which honors thick upon him, taking with him the love of friends, conscious of his own rectitude, commanding the respect of his enemies.</p><p>This is no ordinary man we bury this day; living, he was our first citizen. There were more men who knew him and paid homage to his unostentatious greatness than any other in our city and I can truthfully add in our state.</p><p>It has been truthfully said that MR. WARREN was a leader of men. He was also a leader of measures. In all my intercourse with him I found him to be one of the best I ever knew—ready at all times to receive suggestions, to hear all one had to day, and I think if the suggestion was good his ready comprehension accepted it—but he reserved to himself the right of final judgment, and this I round to be true, great or small. When once he had reached a conclusion, it was usually acceptable. He had no dogmatic assertion about him, nor offensive manner, nor much gift of language to enforce he views; nevertheless no one failed of understanding his positions and knowing his reasons for it.</p><p>He was no half-way man. While there were one hundred and one things and person that he never troubled himself about, although others persistently said he did, yet when he did interest himself all could know of it, and also where he stood and what interest he was for.</p><p>So strong was he as a leader of measures and of men in this state that, had his desire, if had one, been made from his sick bed, it would have had an undoubted influence on shaping the destiny of the state in the senate of the United States. Could this power come to one save he were made upon a broad gauge a great man? The princely property he left behind, earned by himself, is its own testimonial to his capacity as a business man.</p><p>But there was a tenderer relation which he occupied than what has been said would seem to imply. He gathered his friends about him, and no act or word of his ever did aught but contribute to their happiness. I think he was at all times ready to meet the highest or the lowest. No power of wealth of station ever awed him, no arrogance ever obtruded itself upon his lowliest friend.</p><p>He had a gracious temper. Who ever saw his equipoise disturbed? I doubt if his friends every saw him disturbed to what is called a loss of temper; he often felt wronged and so expressed himself, but as for getting mad as commonly accepted, he was as far from it as the howling blast is from balmy summer air.</p><p>There was one power possessed by our dead friend with which we rarely meet. I wish I could tell it better than I shall.</p><p>Between himself and his two sons there existed a confidence and affection which is rarely met with. It was a ease of mutual confidence always maintained. The roots of affection usually reach downward from the parent to the child. Warm constant companionship, producing affections, spreads its roots in all directions, including the heart. That such as the relation between Mr. WARREN and his sons, no one who knew them could help observing.</p><p>He made his companionship acceptable in the highest and best sense to them, one never ashamed that his act should be known to the other. To my mind this is the highest and best possible relation which can exist today. The sons mourn the loss, not only of illustrious father, but of the illustrious friend and companion.</p><p>I can pay no higher tribute to JAMES D. WARREN. I loved him as a friend. We did not misunderstand each other. I shall always recollect that this day from the face of man is lade the remains of a noble man.</p><p>Brief remarks were also made by Judge L. L. Lewis, Judge Robert C. Titus and Police Commissioner I. O. Crissy.</p><p>A committee consisting of Judges Lewis and Titus, Frank C. Laughlin, Superintendent-of-Education J. F. Crooker and County-Treasurer John Esser reported the memorial which was printed in the COMMERCIAL’S noon edition yesterday.</p><p>THE CLEVELAND DEMOCRACY</p><p>The Cleveland Democracy assembled at their rooms at 1.30 and appointed the following members a committee to attend the funeral of MR. WARREN: Herbert P. Bissell, William F. Mackey, Herman Hennig, Allen Brown, W. H. Cuddeback.</p><p>Appropriate action will be taken by the club at its meeting next Monday night.</p><p>ACTION OF THE COMMON COUNCIL</p><p>Immediately after the calling of the roll and the approval of minutes, at the council meeting yesterday afternoon, Ald. Rano offered the following, which was unanimously adopted:</p><p>In the death of JAMES D.

WARREN DEAD.</p><p>AT half-past eight last Thursday evening James D. Warren died. For some weeks there have been fears that the illness from which he suffered intensely would prove fatal; but lately his physicians were led to believe that the disease had taken a more favorable turn, and expectations of his recovery were hopefully entertained. Only Thursday morning friends learned the he had passed a very comfortable night. During the day it was deemed necessary and safe to perform upon him a painful operation and the most favorable result was confidently anticipated. But the effort was too much for his depleted vitality; he did not rally from the consequent exhaustion, but passed away unconscious even of the great relief caused by the dreaded operation.</p><p>From the very first attack he had expected, almost hoped for, death. He knew that his disease was mortal; his venerated father died of it, after enduring untold agony at intervals several years; and when the son learned of his fatal inheritance, he seemed to wish for a speedy ending of it rather to live in such suffering as he had witnessed at his beloved parent&rsquo;s bedside. This was the most unfavorable aspect of his illness. It was the natural impatience of bodily ills which marks the strong and healthy man.</p><p>For even when past three-score Mr. Warren was a walking picture of robust health, a model of manly comeliness and strength. Few men of his years could compare with him in those respects, and none of his age looked younger. He was made on a large scale, and up to the last two months looked good for another score years or more. There is something inexpressably sad in the thought of a strong man cut down so quickly in what seemed to be the very pride of his strength and the utmost height of his usefulness.</p><p>Elsewhere THE EXPRESS prints the particulars of his life. Here it is not intended to do more than to speak briefly of Mr. Warren&rsquo;s marked characteristics, as they struck one who was closely associated with him for fifteen years. The memory of those fifteen years of intimate friendship and perfect confidence is stronger and even fresher no, and will be more enduring, than the recollection of anything that has unpleasantly occurred between them in the nine years since.</p><p>Mr. Warren was eminently a man of business, with all of an upright business-man&rsquo;s keen regard for his commercial reputations. His financial credit was always higher than that of many men of double his wealth. It was his first concern. In business affairs he was prudent and discreet, and successful of course. He made few losses, and knew how to keep what he had gained. Those who think of him first as a politician, as so many will, mistake his leading trait. He was first of all a man of business. Circumstances not of his own choosing, made him a political leader, and for the last five years, hardly any Republican in the State of New-York wielded a greater influence than he easily exerted in shaping the party&rsquo;s action in its nominating conventions both local and national.</p><p>Yet, but ten years ago, it was difficult to persuade Mr. Warren to remain on the State Committee, and he had absolutely no political ambition. He cared nothing for political power or honor. Yet, within the last two or three years, he was a candidate for the highest honors and greatest leadership his party in this State could bestow. Such wonderful changes will a few years work in men and things! And yet he was peculiarly a man of common sense. Political ambition, if it was in him ever, was a plant of late growth and an exotic at that. If he sought office it was because other men sorely wanted him to have it.</p><p>Many friends who think they knew Mr. Warren pretty well will find it hard to believe all this of him. But it is the truth. He labored more zealously to promote other men&rsquo;s ambitions than h i sown. Left to his own devices he would lately have lived a life of ease, in the enjoyment of the wealth which he had acquired in honorable business pursuits. He was fond of home and simple surrounding. He was justly proud of his ownership of the <em>Buffalo Commercial Advertiser,</em> and the fine printing business and splendid building with which the time-honored title is identified. But he had no false pride of any kind. He felt himself the equal of most men, but was never lofty with the lowly. In his domestic relations his life was beyond reproach. He was devoted to wife and children and generous with those of his blood not so near or dear.</p><p>It has been thought of Mr. Warren and not altogether without reason, that he was fond of money. This brief sketch of his character may well be closed with a statement which proves that honor was dearer to him than money. Together with the present writer, as joint proprietor of the <em>Commercial,</em> the firm was once sued for libel with damages laid at a hundred thousand dollars. The evening before the case was to come of for trial, after many delays, the partner who had the greater moral responsibility for the trouble was informed by the plaintiff&rsquo;s distinguished counsel that if the <em>Commercial</em> would publish only a few lines, to the effect that upon documentary evidence submitted to its editor its proprietors had become convinced that the publication complained of was incorrect and unjust, the suit would be withdrawn. No apology was asked for. Upon the spur of the moment, without opportunity for consulting with Mr. Warren, the editor rejected the proposition. Evidence sufficient to convince him that, the plaintiff had been wronged could convince the jury, he said, and if the <em>Commercial</em> had done the plaintiff such a plain wrong as that, its proprietors ought to suffer for it and they were willing to pay the damages. Next morning, an hour or two before the case was called, Mr. Warren was informed of what his partner had done. &ldquo;What would <em>you</em> have said?&rdquo; asked the editor. &ldquo;Just what you said!&rdquo; answered Mr. Warren instantly. &ldquo;But suppose they get a verdict, what then?&rdquo; &ldquo;Why then, by –, we’ll pay it!” said Mr. Warren, with an oath which had in it no flavor of impiety.</p><p>That was the spirit of a proud, brave man, and the story is told here and now with a sort of sad pleasure in the reminiscence. Mr. Warren surely did not love money too well in that case. He was loyal and steadfast in the hour of trial. And perhaps some of his many friends will be glad to be told, or reminded that the libel suit was tried most ably on both sides, and that the verdict was “For the Defendants.”</p></blockquote><figcaption>

WARREN,</p><p>THE PROPRIETOR OF THE &ldquo;BUFFALO COMMERCIAL ADVERTISER&rdquo; DIED FRIDAY EVENING.</p><p>Various Expressions of Sorrow.</p><p>James D. Warren, proprietor of the <em>Commercial Advertiser</em>, died quite unexpectedly at half past eight o&rsquo;clock last evening, at his home on North Street. Though he was known to be seriously ill, no one seems to have been aware of his critical condition until within a few hours of the end. His physicians predicted his recovery only a day or two ago. Though it was known that he did not take this hopeful view of his condition, and it was also known that he had hardly more than an even chance with his disease, it was late yesterday afternoon before any one saw that the end was near.</p><p>The disease which terminated fatally made its appearance early in October, and during that month he visited New York to confer with the State Committee, going as a member by proxy. While in. New York Mr. Warren visited, among other friends, ex-President Arthur, finding the latter out of health, and leaving him with a sentiment of deep sadness, feeling and saying that he should never see him again. He came home quite unwell, His trip had failed to do for him what his friends had hoped. He was threatened with local inflammatory troubles of hereditary character and was quite nervous about his condition. From the first he was quite discouraged. His father had died of the same disease, and he believed he was about to follow him. But be struggled against the attack and went to the office for some time. Towards the last of October he was advised by his physician, Dr. J. D, Hill, to stay at home and submit to severe treatment for his disease. He was then threatened with acute inflammation of the bladder, and was obliged to remain at home.</p><p>For a time the disorder appeared to yield to treatment. Mr. Warren arose every day and his friends went to see him. On Election Day they urged him to go out and vote and he was driven to the polls. This was the last day he went out, though he was not materially worse for several days. His physician predicted that if he was patient he would come around all right. But he was not hopeful, and would often say that he had to go. On the Friday before Thanksgiving he felt better than for Several days before, and talked about getting well. On the next day unfavorable symptoms set in and Dr. Burwell was called in for counsel. The Doctor said that while alarming symptoms were present they were not necessarily fatal. Here was a staunch ship, to use Dr, Burwell’s words, that had been sailing over 60 years. The ship had got on the rocks, but he trusted they could float her.</p><p>It was but an even chance, however, after that, and complications appeared during the last three weeks of his life that greatly discouraged his doctors. Precisely what the final ailment was will be revealed only by the autopsy which, on the request of the physicians, is to be held. About ten days ago a swelling appeared on the inner side of his left thigh near the groin. It was at first thought to be merely sympathetic with his bladder trouble, but it did not disappear, and on Dr. Hill&rsquo;s becoming ill, Dr. Roswell Park was called, who, with Dr, Burwell, concluded to open the swelling, on the supposition of its being an abscess. This was done yesterday, the patient appearing to suffer but little from the operation. The doctors predicted that he would improve, but an hour later he suffered a severe chill, followed by a high fever. His temperature rose to 105 and his pulse to 140, and he soon became unconscious, from which state he never rallied, At 4 P. M. his physicians gave up hope, and at 6 they said he must go almost immediately. His iron constitution, however, prolonged life until 8.30, when he passed away without a struggle.</p><p>By his first wife Mr. Warren had one child, Mr. Orsamus G. Warren. Mr. William C. Warren and Mrs. Isaac H. Bromley, Jr., are offspring of the second union.</p><p>EXPRESSIONS OF SORROW.</p><p>Prominent Men Who Knew Mr. Warren Intimately Talk Feelingly about Him.</p><p>Towards the close of the meeting of the General Committee on Charter Revision at the Mayor&rsquo;s office last evening, the news of James D. Warren&rsquo;s death was received by telephone. It was announced very feelingly by Mr. James C. Fullerton, and created profound regret.</p><p>In moving the appointment of a committee of three to draft suitable resolutions, Mr. Fullerton said it was unnecessary for him to say anything in eulogy of a man who commanded so deeply the respect and sympathy of such a body as that present, who knew and appreciated the merits of Mr. Warren as a citizen, and his great services to the community as a public man. He had always placed uppermost in his breast the dictates of duty.</p><p>The motion that the chairman appoint a committee of three to draft suitable resolutions to be presented at the next meeting was seconded by Mayor Becker. The chair appointed Mr. James C. Fullerton, Mr. George Gorham, and Gen. John C. Graves as such committee.</p><p>A Banking Friend.</p><p>Gen. Rufus L. Howard, who was called upon at a late hour last night, said that be had been very much surprised at the news of Mr. Warren&rsquo;s death.</p><p>Gen. Howard said he hardly felt able that evening to say much with respect to Mr. Warren&rsquo;s life or his personal knowledge of him as a friend. &ldquo;I have known him,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;ever since I came to Buffalo, and have always entertained for him a warm regard. He was a clear-headed, shrewd business man, and in all his business relations, as far as I am enabled to say, was perfectly upright and a pleasant man to meet.</p><p>&ldquo;My business relations with him have been closer since I became Vice-President of the White&rsquo;s Bank. Since his sickness I have taken more or less charge of the bank&rsquo;s affairs and to-morrow I shall call a meeting of the directors, as of course the bank cannot be closed immediately.&rdquo;</p><p>A Democratic Friend.</p><p>Judge James M. Humphrey, who has known Mr. Warren 35 years, said of him as his own home last night: &ldquo;He was a remarkably good business-man in every department of business. He was an honest, upright man. He was a profound judge of men–of human nature. He had largely the elements and characteristics that made him a leader among men, in politics especially. He was a strong partisan, yet not so strong as to do injustice to the motives of those opposed to him. He had a strong, decided, and positive convictions, and followed them out with both determination and sagacity. I think him to have been one of the leading men whose opinions and judgment were as highly regarded in the State as any man in his party occupying a private position. He exercised a controlling — a very controlling interest in the political action of his party in this County and had done so for a good many years. Mr. Warren was, moreover, a man of fine social qualities, and genial nature. He appreciated his friends and was true to them. His death will be a great loss to the business community and to his party.&rdquo;</p><p>A Political Friend.</p><p>The Hon. Benjamin H. Williams got the News of Mr. Warren’s death from a reporter for THE EXPRESS. Said he:</p><p>“I feel his death is a great personal loss to me on the score of friendship. I had a very high opinion of Mr. Warren as a citizen, and as a man I had a great esteem for him. I regard his death as a great loss, not only to his family but to his immediate friends, the community, and I might also say to the State.”</p><p>A Business Friend.</p><p>Alfred P. Wright, an old friend of Mr. Warren, was grieved to learn of his death. &ldquo;Personally,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I feel that I have lost a very dear friend. I have known him for a great many years intimately. I have always been associated with him in politics, with the exception of one year, when we differed, but that did not interfere with our personal friendship. He was a strong, sterling, upright man. Occupying the position he did, he could not help making some political mistakes and some political enemies.</p><p>&ldquo;His integrity was above suspicion. He was very strong in his friendships, and had the faculty of holding the friends he made. He was the most lovable man to his family that you can possibly imagine. I feel that the city of Buffalo has lost one of its best men, whose place it will be hard to fill—one who has battled for years for Buffalo and its interests.&rdquo;</p><p>A Boyhood Friend.</p><p>The Hon. Nelson K. Hopkins was deeply grieved when he learned the sad news. “I believe I have been acquainted with Mr. Warren longer than any other man in the city,” said Mr. Hopkins, “having become acquainted with him during his early boyhood. He was, during the early part of his life, a steady, faithful, and industrious young man. When I first knew him he was a clerk in his father’s store in Clarence Hollow. Since he has been a resident of Buffalo, he character has been almost too well known to the public for me to dwell on it. He has always occupied a high and honorable position.</p><p>“We have always belonged to the same party. He has achieved a reputation as a citizen and in his party as a gentleman that is not excelled by any other man. He has always been a man of very high character and undoubted integrity. His loss will be greatly felt throughout the entire community.”</p><p>The news of Mr. Warren’s death was known down town soon after the sad event occurred, and from all sides were heard expressions of sincere regret. Many old friend of the deceased whom reporters for THE EXPRESS called on last night had either retired or were so overcome at the reception of the sad news that they felt unable to make at that time any adequate expression of their feelings.</p><p>IN CHRONOLOGICAL ORDER.</p><p>The formal facts of James D. Warren’s Long and Many-Sided Career.</p><p>From Smith’s “History of the City of Buffalo and Erie County.”</p><p>James D. Warren was born in the town of Bennington, Wyoming, N. Y., on the 19th of January, 1823. His father, the late Orsamus Warren, was a farmer and one of the pioneers of Wester New York. After a brief residence in Bennington he moved to the town of Wales, Erie County, and from thence shortly afterwards to the town of Clarence, Erie County, where he purchased and settled upon a farm situated about a mile from the village. He also carried on a country store at Clarence, dealing in a general assortment of dry-goods, groceries, and farmer’s implements.</p><p>When the family moved to Clarence the subject of this notice was about two years old. He attended school, wrought upon the farm and assisted his father in the management of the village store. Before attaining his majority Mr. Warren made a tour of the South, spending about a year in Natchez, Miss. Returning North, he engaged in business in Clarence, following mercantile and farming pursuits, and was elected a Supervisor for several terms from that town. In 1854, at the age of 31, Mr. Warren was elected County Treasurer, and served a term of three years. He subsequently held the office of Clerk of the Board of Supervisors for two or three, terms, and in April, 1861, in connection with Joseph Wheeler and Joseph Candee, he purchased the Commercial Advertiser newspaper, and entered upon his life-work,—that of publisher.</p><p>In 1863 Messrs. Wheeler and Warren purchased Mr. Candee’s interest, and immediately after Mr. James N, Matthews was admitted into the firm. Mr. Wheeler retired from business some two years afterwards, and the firm then became Matthews & Warren. In 1877 Mr. Warren purchased the interest of his partner in the <em>Commercial Advertiser,</em> and has since that time been its sole proprietor and publisher.</p><p>He is an earnest and active Republican, and has been prominently identified with that party since its organization. The only offices he has held, as above stated, are Supervisor, Erie County Treasurer, and Clerk of the Board of Supervisors. He has been active and influential in the direction and management of party affairs, serving repeatedly as a member of the State Central Committee, as well as a delegate to the State and National nominating conventions. He is what is known as a Stalwart Republican, and is the recognized leader of that branch of the party in Erie County, if not in Western New York. His sound good sense, thorough knowledge of human nature, keen observation, valuable experience in affairs, and genial disposition combine to make him not only a successful man in business, but a far-seeing politician as well. Under his direction and management the <em>Commercial Advertiser</em> has become the leading Republican newspaper of Western New York.</p><p>He is also president of White&rsquo;s Bank, one of the oldest and most substantial financial institutions in Buffalo. Mr. Warren has been twice married—first to Miss Laura Love, daughter of the late George Love, by whom he had one son. After her death he married Miss Mary Mills, daughter of the late Judge Mils of Clarence, by whom he has had one son and two daughters.</p><p>THE DEAD POLITICIAN.</p><p>What He Did and also What He Was Both in State and National Affairs.</p><p>The following sketch of the dead leader’s career in State and National politics is based on material furnished by some of the gentlemen connected with the <em>Commercial Advertiser</em> who shared Mr. Warren’s political activity.</p><p>Mr. Warren, Mr. Arthur, Mr. Conkling, and Alonzo B. Cornell were the delegates-at-large from New York State to the Republican National Convention in Chicago in 1880. Mr. Warren was one of the leaders in the movement which culminated in the 206 convention votes for Grant. In 1884 he was again a delegate to the Republican National Convention also at Chicago, this time representing his district. At this convention he was the recognized leader of the Arthur forces, and mad a hard fight against Mr. Blaine. On the latter’s nomination Mr. Warren gave him support through his journal, the <em>Buffalo Commercial Advertiser,</em> and as the chairman of the Republican Central Committee of New York State.</p><p>He was a delegate to every State Convention of his party in New York held since 1872. That was the memorable year in the political management of the State. Mr. Greeley’s candidacy as an independent was a disturbing influence in the Republican party. Up to that time the State machinery had been controlled by Gen. Fenton and his forces, but now it passed into the hands of Senator Conkling and his supporters. From 1872 to 1882 they held the undisturbed control of the party organization.</p><p>As a member of the State Central Committee during these years Mr. Warren did eminent work for the party organization. In 1883 he became Chairman of the Committee. That was the year succeeding the Cleveland cyclone, which gave the head of the Democratic ticket 192,000 majority. It was under Mr. Warren’s management that the State was reclaimed to the Republicans by the election of the head of their ticket—Gen. Carr, for Secretary of State—while the Democratic majority for the remainder of the ticket was cut down to the merest margin.</p><p>It was at Mr. Blaine’s request that he became chairman of the committee in 1884. Mr. Warren strongly opposed some of the steps of the closing days of that campaign, to which the defeat of Mr. Blaine is commonly attributed. He was opposed to the Delmonico dinner, and counseled against the ministers’ meeting at which the Rev. Dr. Burchard made use of his ill-advised phrase, “Rum, Romanism, and Rebellion.” It was Mr. Warren’s advice that if the meeting be held at all the speakers first write out what they intended to say and submit the manuscript to the party managers; but the National Committee looked upon this as a needless precaution and the advice was disregarded.</p><p>Throughout the campaign of 1884 Mr. Warren gave unflagging personal attention to the work. For nearly three months he remained in News York City, almost constantly devoted to the labor of the Committee. The strain was so terrible that he barely escaped prostration, and for this reason firmly declined to go on the Committee again.</p><p>Mr. Warren was prominently mentioned as a candidate for United States Senator when Mr. Evarts was elected, and was a candidate for Governor in the convention of 1885, receiving 138 votes. His name has also been mentioned in connection with the Senatorial election this year.</p><p>THE FUNERAL</p><p>Many Distinguished Men Pay a Last Tribute to the Memory of the Deceased.</p><p>The funeral of James D. Warren took place from his late home, No. 222 North Street, at 2.30 o&rsquo;clock Monday afternoon. The attendance in every way was a large and very representative one. It seemed as though every townsman of note had come to pay his last respects to the memory of Mr. Warren, and the number of distinguished friends from out of town was also large, a partial list of whom is given below.</p><p>The remains rested in a solid cedar casket, covered with a fine black broadcloth. The concave top, around which extended a silken cord with tassels at each side, bore a few simple but beautiful flowers, roses and lilies of the valley, forming a pillar and a wreath, the gifts of a few friends and of the employees of the <em>Commercial</em>. The casket was lined with richly trimmed plaited satin, and had oxydized silver extension bar and end handles. The following was the inscription borne on a solid silver plate:</p><p>JAMES D. WARREN.</p><p>BORN JANUARY 19, 1823.</p><p>DIED DECEMBER 17, 1886.</p><p>A polished cedar box, with neat silver handles and a copper plate bearing an inscription, enclosed the casket. In the east parlor, in which the remains thus enclosed had been placed, were gathered distinguished men from all parts of the State and from Washington. Among them, besides a number of prominent citizens of Buffalo, were:</p><p>United-States-Senator Warner Miller, Mr. C. W. Hackett of Utica, Chairman of the Republican State Executive Committee; Mr. John A. Sleicher, editor of the <em>Albany Journal</em>; Mr. John M. Davy of Rochester; ex-Congressman James S. Smart of Washington County; Mr. Henry S. Abell, formerly private secretary to Gov. Cornell; ex-Collector Pierce of Canandaigua; Collector O. W. Cutler of Lockport; Mr. Willard A. Cobb, editor of the <em>Lockport Journal</em>; ex-Congressman Richard Crowley of New-York; Congressman John B, Weber; ex-Assemblyman Amos H. Baker; Mr. Charles E. Fitch editor of the <em>Rochester Democrat and Chronicle</em>; Judge A. S. Draper, State Superintendent of Public Instruction; Mr. H. H. Warner of Rochester; Assemblyman Peter A. Porter of Niagara Falls; the Hon. Carroll Whitaker; State-Senator T. E. Ellsworth of Lockport.</p><p>The family occupied a place in the upper hall, in the front part of which was a large delegation from the Press Club. The Republican League and the Cleveland Democracy were also represented by delegations. In the lower front parlor to the west were gathered many of Mr. Warren’s old friends and acquaintances, including some of the most prominent citizens of Buffalo. Seated in a room just in the rear of the hall were Mayor Becker and a delegation of officials of the city and county, and the employees of the <em>Commercial</em>. In the east parlor up stairs were the <em>Commercial</em> staff, and in the west parlor the following bearers: Mr. James A. Roberts, Mr. George Urban, Jr., Col. John Byrne, Judge George A. Lewis, the Hon, Jacob Stern, Mr. Henry C. French, Mr. William E. Clark, and Mr. William B, Sirrett; and the honorary bearers: The Hon. Charles Daniels; Gen. R. L. Howard, the Hon. Nelson K. Hopkins, the Hon. James M. Humphrey, Mr. John L. Williams, Mr. Henry W. Box, the Hon. Solomon Scheu, Mr. Robert Keating.</p><p>The officiating clergyman was the Rev, Dr. T. Ralston Smith, pastor of Westminster Presbyterian Church, who read the service of his church as a preface to his remarks, There was no music.</p><p>The family of the deceased, the staff of the <em>Commercial</em>, Senator Miller, and other distinguished friends of Mr. Warren from out of town followed the remains to Forest Lawn, where the body was placed in the receiving vault to await interment. The exercises at the cemetery were very brief, simple, and impressive.</p><p>Where the body will finally be interred has not been decided, though it is likely to be at Clarence, Mr. Warren&rsquo;s old home, and the resting place of the mortal remains of his father.</p><p>IN MEMORIAM.</p><p>Action of Various Organizations on the Death of Mr. James D. Warren.</p><p>Since Mr. Warren&rsquo;s death many organizations have formally expressed their grief at, and the loss sustained by City, State, and Party through his demise. Each has borne testimonial to Mr. Warren&rsquo;s worth as a man, as a publisher, and as a leader of the Republican party. Memorials have been adopted by the directors of White&rsquo;s Bank, of which the deceased was president; by his employees, the newspaper men, the Buffalo Republican League, the Republican County Executive Committee, the Fifth Ward Republicans, the Union Veteran Legion, the City Hall officials, and the Common Council. The Board of Supervisors has appointed a committee to draft a suitable memorial, for which a page in the official proceedings will be reserved.</p></blockquote><figcaption>

WARREN.</p><p>Death of one of Buffalo&rsquo;s Most Prominent Citizen&rsquo;s–Universal Expression of Regret—Action of the Press Club.</p><p>The news of the death of Mr. Warren last Friday evening created a profound sensation. It is not our intention to give any extended sketch of the distinguished gentleman’s life, or of his prominence as a citizen, politician or business man. That has all been done so eloquently and copiously since the announcement of Mr. Warren’s death, and before it, not only by the press of Buffalo, but of the entire state irrespective of party, that it is unnecessary to do so here. Mr. Warren was best known outside of Buffalo as the proprietor of the <em>Commercial Advertiser</em> and a prominent leader of the Republican party. In Buffalo he was known as an upright business man, an ideal employer, and a genial, warm-hearted friend.</p><p>The various civic and political bodies, the employes of the different departments of the <em>Commercial</em> printing house, and the Press Club met promptly after the announcement of Mr. Warren’s death and took appropriate action. We append herewith the report of the action taken by the Press Club, which we find in Monday’s <em>Commercial</em>:</p><p>ACTION OF MEMBERS OF THE PRESS.</p><p>A largely attended meeting of members of the press was held Saturday evening at the rooms of the Press Club, to take action on the death of Mr. Warren. President Mcintosh called the meeting to order, briefly stating its purpose, and saying that it seemed proper though Mr. Warren had not been a member of that club, that the body take some action on his decease.</p><p>On motion of Mr. George Ferris, the Rev. Father Cronin was called to the chair, on assuming which he spoke as follows:</p><p>“Gentlemen–I should regard myself guilty of culpable neglect in the performance of a solemn and melancholy duty did I fail to unite with you to-night in paying a suitable tribute to the memory of James D. Warren.</p><p>“Alas! that in moments such as these the tongue should be weak to express what the heart so strongly feels.</p><p>“I have been profoundly impressed with the announcement of Mr. Warren’s death.</p><p>“Like a towering forest oak stricken by unexpected lightning from a summer sky, so comes the merciless arrow of the inevitable destroyer to one who indeed towered aloft above the crowd, not only by his commanding presence and superb physique, but by his strong personality and far-reaching influence as well.</p><p>“Reflecting upon the all too untimely death of Mr. Warren—snatched away in the midst of his vigor, his usefulness, his power and his fame, who can help exclaiming to himself at least: And what is it all when all is done! It seems like the sudden dropping of the curtain and the quenching of the lights ere the play is half over.</p><p>“I am aware indeed how utterly vain is spoken praise to “the dull cold ear of death.” But we owe it to the living, we owe it to our city, we owe it to the state, aye, we owe it to the nation to record our estimate of Mr. Warren’s rare worth, ere his remains be consigned to their final rest.</p><p>“I shall not dwell now on the varied aspects of his long and useful career. That has been done to-day by the kindly pens of our city press; and the story of the dead journalist’s life will be rehearsed throughout the land.</p><p>“He was no child of enervating fortune. Like nearly all our great men, Mr. Warren sprang from the people; and all his manhood years were with the people and for them. And if those years were crowned with signal success—with large wealth and commanding influence–that success was achieved by resourceful brain, tireless labor and high endeavor. I have long regarded Mr. Warren as a typical American, simple in his tastes, strong in his convictions, rigorous in upholding them, he was warm as a friend and honorable as a foe; and while feeling himself the equal of any, he stooped to the lowly with an affability that won their hearts.</p><p>“Such is the impression left upon me during my occasional intercourse with the distinguished dead.</p><p>“In his demise Buffalo loses one of her foremost citizens, his party a sage in council and a hero in battle, his friends a man of whose regard they had reason to be proud, and the people of whatever condition, one whose sympathy was theirs and upon whose word they could rely.</p><p>“I am glad to state that my acquaintance with Mr. Warren was of the pleasantest character; and now that he is gone, I only wish I could pierce the desolation that enshrouds his lately happy home with some ray of sunshine, which joining you gentlemen in weaving for the memory of the illustrious dead a heart-wreath of immortelles.”</p><p>F. F. Fargo said he too had felt profoundly the shock of the sudden news which reached him that morning regarding the death of their distinguished friend and fellow citizen. Mr. Warren was no ordinary man, and in honoring him they honored themselves. Although not a journalist in the strictest sense of the word, Mr. Warren was a publicist of large experience and extended knowledge. After spending most of the years of his mature life at newspaper work he had come to occupy a proud position in the front rank, it might be said, among the journalists of the country. His influence and knowledge of men and affairs were not by any means limited to Buffalo. He was known and respected throughout the state and nation, and the death of such a man was a public calamity. Having thus been stricken down in the very prime of his manhood, his place in Buffalo would not be easily filled. The speaker moved the appointment of a committee of five to draft suitable resolution. Carried, and the chair appointed Messrs. F. F. Fargo, Wm. McIntosh, Norman E. Mack, Matthias Rohr, and Arthur W. Austin.</p><p>While the committee was making its report, Mr. R. C. Hill took occasion to add a few words, saying that his experiences with and reminiscences of Mr. Warren were most satisfactory. He deplored the loss of one so respected, and one who so ably represented the journalistic profession in Buffalo. He hoped a general expression of the entire press, irrespective of club membership, would be obtained, as he was sure the whole press united in regretting the loss of this respected member.</p><p>Mr. Ambrose Butler took occasion to say that he was not personally acquainted with Mr. Warren, but his brother had known him well. He had just received a telegram from Mr. E. H. Butler saying the he deeply regretted the death of Mr. Warren, and united in paying tribute to his memory.</p><p>Chairman Fargo then reported the following resolutions, which were unanimously adopted, as the sentiment of the meeting:</p><p>The death of James D. Warren in the fullness of vigor and manhood is an incalculable loss to the city, the state and the nation. His influence and usefulness were not limited to municipal locality, but were felt throughout the commonwealth, even extending to the very boundaries of the Union itself.</p><p>Cast in a large mold, Mr. Warren instinctively took a broad and comprehensive view of affairs, and was readily recognized by his fellows as a leader of men. He was proverbially modest, never preferring nor urging his own claims or merits, but rather promoting those of others often less meritorious than his own.</p><p>Mr. Warren was a manly man. Always dignified and courteous, never trifling or demeaning himself, he therefore commanded the respect of all classes of men. In society, business and political affairs he occupied a place in the front rank and the place was not only occupied but filled. His knowledge of men and affairs seemed intuitive, his judgment as unerring as is possible for human opinions to be, and his integrity was without a blemish. His private life was without a reproach and his death is an almost unbearable bereavement to his afflicted family.</p><p>The Press Club, speaking for itself and the press of the city of Buffalo, feel it an honor to place this brief testimonial upon the bier of one who has added lustre in the profession of which it is a representative.</p><p><em>Resolved,</em> That the members of the club will attend the obsequies of Mr. Warren in a body, and invite members of the press generally to join them.</p><p><em>Resolved,</em> That an engrossed copy of the foregoing, attested by the officers of the club, be presented to the family of the deceased.</p><p>The resolutions as first read were indicative only of regret on the part of the Press Club, but on motion of Mr. R. C. Hill, the words “and the press of the city of Buffalo” were interpolated and they were thus adopted.</p><p>Mr. Leslie Thom paid a tribute to the memory of Mr. Warren, saying that he deeply regretted the loss of a man whom he had known personally and who had made a deep and abiding impression on the affairs of the city, while at the same time he took a melancholy pleasure in thus giving utterance to the regard for the deceased.</p><p>Mr. Matthias Rohr gave voice to the sentiments of respect concerning the loss to the community of a man who was so great a figure in it, and whom he had known so well.</p><p>Arthur W. Austin said the sentiments of the entire staff of the <em>Commercial Advertiser</em> had been so well set forth in a brief editorial contained in the paper of that evening, that any further words from him would be superfluous. They all felt they had lost a true, kind, steadfast friend, one who had always been considerate in his treatment of his employes, ever ready to overlook failings and prompt to commend what he deemed commendable.</p><p>Mr. Fargo moved that as the resolutions provided that the press should attend in a body, that a committee of arrangements be appointed by the chair to provide for this, and the following committee was named: Messrs. F. F. Fargo, George Bleistein, George M. Hausaffer, E. H. Butler, Eugene Fleury, Norman E. Mack.</p><p>The meeting then adjourned.</p></blockquote><figcaption>

Warren.</p><p>The death of James. D. Warren, proprietor of the Buffalo Commercial, occurred at his residence on North Street, Buffalo, at 8:30 o&rsquo;clock, on Friday evening last.</p><p>Mr. Warren was born on a farm in the town of Bennington, Wyoming county, N. Y., January 19, 1823. His father, the late Orsamus Warren, was one of the pioneers of Western New York. After a brief residence in Bennington, the elder Warren removed with his family to the town of Wales, Erie county, and again to Clarence, where he settled upon a farm located about a mile from the village. James D. was two years old when this settlement was made. He worked upon the farm as be grew to youth and manhood, assisted also in the management of the village store which his father owned. Here, in the midst of an endless variety of merchandise, with supplies to be bought and sold, accounts to be kept, he acquired a business training and a better knowledge of the world than the drudgery of farm life afforded. His neighbors began to see in him a keen, enterprising man, one who has a good future before him and one in whose hands their own interests could be safely trusted. So they elected him Supervisor several times in succession, as against older and more experienced men. His record in the Board of Supervisors made him the Republican candidate for treasurer of Erie County in 1854, when he was only 3l years of age. He was elected. After serving a term of three years he retired, but was soon chosen to the position of clerk of the Board of Supervisors. He was twice re-elected to this position. In April, 1861, in connection with Joseph Wheeler and Joseph Candee, he purchased the Commercial Advertiser and entered upon the active life of a publisher. In 1862 Messrs. Wheeler and Warren purchased Mr. Candee’s interest and then admitted James N. Matthews into the firm. Mr. Wheeler retired from the concern in 1864 and the firm then became Mathews & Warren. The partnership continued for 13 years. In 1877 the disagreement of the partners resulted in the purchase by Mr. Warren of Mr. Matthews’ interest. Since that time the former has been the sole proprietor of the paper. While holding no other offices than those already mentioned, Mr. Warren has never ceased to be an active and influential Republican. Mr. Warren was twice married, his first wife having been Miss Laura Love, daughter of the late George Love, by whom he had one son. After her death he married Miss Mary Mills, daughter of the late Judge Mills, by whom he had one son and two daughters. Mr. Warren was for a number of years prior to his death president of White&rsquo;s Bank of Buffalo.</p><p>The funeral took place Monday afternoon from his late residence.</p></blockquote><figcaption>

WARREN.</p><p>Death is ever a most unwelcome visitor, whether it be to the infant, budding youth with buoyant hopes, to early manhood, or those of maturer years, and the loss at all times brings unmeasured grief, and we wonder at the strange providences which tears our loved away. To the public the loss is more varied and according to public and private merits and more in keeping with the sterling qualities of a noble manhood. Such an one was James D. Warren, son of a country merchant of Clarence. Reared in the pursuits of business, he acquired habits which led him forward not only to distinction and wealth, but to the ownership and management of one of the leading newspapers tn the State and country. The editor of the <em>Express</em>, James N. Matthews, his former partner, says of him:</p><p>“Mr. Warren was eminently a man of business, with all of an upright business man’s keen regard for his commercial reputation. His financial credit was always higher than that many men of double his wealth. It was his first concern. In business affairs he was prudent and discreet, and successful of course, He made few losses, and knew how to keep what he gained, Those who think of him first as a politician, as so many will, mistake his leading trait. He was first of all a man of business. Circumstances, not of his own choosing, made him a political leader and for the last five years hardly any Republican in the State of New York wielded a greater influence than he easily exerted in shaping the party&rsquo;s action in its nominating conventions, both local and national.</p><p>“Yet, but ten years ago, it was difficult to persuade Mr. Warren to remain on the State Committee, and be had absolutely no political ambition. He cared nothing for political power or honor. Yet, within the last two or three years, he was a candidate for the highest honors and greatest leadership his party in this State could bestow. Such wonderful changes will a few years work in men and things! And yet he was peculiarly a man of commons sense. Political ambition, if it was in him ever, was a plant of late growth and an exotic at that, If he sought office it was because other men sorely wanted him to have it.</p><p>“Many friends who think they knew Mr. Warren pretty well will find it hard to believe all this of him. But it is the truth. He labored more zealously to promote other men’s ambitions than his own. Left to his own devices he would lately have lived a life of ease, in the enjoyment of the wealth which he had acquired in honorable business pursuits. He was fond of home and simple surroundings. He was justly proud of his ownership of the Buffalo Commercial Advertiser, and of the fine printing business and splendid building with which that time-honored title is identified. But he had no false pride of any kind. He felt himself the equal of most men, but was never lofty with the lowly. In his domestic relations his life was beyond reproach. He was devoted to wife and children and generous with those of his blood not so near and dear.”</p><p>What a noble tribute to the memory of a deceased friend; and as Mr. Matthews and Mr. Warren were partners for years, none other can speak from greater personal knowledge. Mr. Warren was a man of commanding presence, and one of nature&rsquo;s noblemen. He had a heart as tender and sympathetic as a child. Let a friend go and say, “My friend needs your assistance,” and if the cause was just Mr. Warren felt the full force and he would make the cause many times more than he would have ever asked for himself under any circumstances which he might have been placed. As a friend he was the most devoted, and if anyone was worthy of his friendship they received its fullest measure, As Mr. Matthews says, &ldquo;circumstances not of his own choosing made him a political leader,” and truly so; his wonderful discreetness, good judgment and prudence in business made his voice equally potent in politics, and when this was manifested as a member of the State Committee and in his party councils, this of its own force made him a political leader. He would undoubtedly have been nominated for Governor in ’85 but for the fact that the wing of the party to which he belonged had the minority of votes in the convention. His name was also freely canvassed in connection with United States Senator. At his death he must have been worth a half million dollars. His sons were so thoroughly educated into the management of his large newspaper business that it Would appear that all he had to do was to retire and enjoy the results of a successful life&rsquo;s efforts. Mr. Warren was not aged, but barely past 60 years, while he appeared but little more than 50. The announcement of his death caused a profound sensation in all circles, and as he had been the friend of all in life, so his death is not only a matter of public and private regret, but causes the loss of a most honored citizen not alone to Buffalo but to the State.</p></blockquote><figcaption>

WARREN.</p><p>He Passed Away Peacefully at 9.15 This Morning—A Biographical Sketch— His Political and Business Career.</p><p>This is a terribly sad day for the BUFFALO COMMERCIAL, and all its employees and friends.</p><p>Orsamus G. Warren, the honored and beloved head of the establishment, died at his residence on North street at 9.15 this morning, after a very brief illness, at the age of 45 years. He was cut down in the very prime of his life, and just at the time when his usefulness seemed greatest. It is, indeed, an inscrutable dispensation of Providence.</p><p>It only remains to tell in brief, the story of his last illness, and give a few prominent facts regarding his life.</p><p>Mr. Warren had been very active in his business affairs throughout the winter and spring, but his health continued good, and he seemed in fact, to be more than usually vigorous.</p><p>He went to New York last month to attend the annual meeting of the State Associated Press, of which be was President, and which was held April 19th and 20th. He remained in the Metropolis for a week later, and returned home to Buffalo on Wednesday morning, April 27th. That same night he left for Albany to attend the Republican State Convention, which was held there Thursday, April 28th.</p><p>He returned home on Friday morning, and it is thought, caught the fatal cold on the sleeping car. He attended to business part of the day on Friday last—only one week ago—and in the afternoon complained of feeling chilly and remained at home. The following day he was also unable to leave the house, though nothing serious was apprehended. He put himself under the care of Dr. Stockton, the family physician. His condition grew worse, however, and Wednesday morning the case was diagnosed as lobar pneumonia. Drs. Cary and Rochester were called in consultation, and the three physicians have since been unremitting, trying everything that their skill and experience could suggest, but all to no purpose. As the COMMERCIAL stated yesterday, the case was looked upon with grave anxiety. The patient was unconscious most of the time. As yesterday wore on it became evident that the chances for recovery were not so good, but a slight rally in the evening gave some encouragement. The fatal change, however, came about 3 o’clock this morning, since which time he sank rapidly, and passed away at 9.15, calmly and peacefully, surrounded by his beloved family and most devoted friends.</p><p>BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.</p><p>Orsamns George Warren was born in Clarence, Erie County, July 21st, 1846, and was the eldest son of the late James D. Warren and Laura Love, his first wife. Orsamus attended school at Clarence and at the age of ten years came to Buffalo and attended school here. He also spent a year at the Canandaigua Academy. At the age of 17 he went to Europe with the late James N. Matthews, and made an extended tour of the continent. He also spent several months in study at Paris.</p><p>On his return to Buffalo, in 1867, he entered the counting room of the COMMERCIAL ADVERTISER office as a bookkeeper, the firm at that time being Matthews & Warren. His connection with the establishment continued uninterrupted to the day of his death. When his father, the late James D. Warren, became sole proprietor, the son became his business manager and practical associate. James D. Warren died December 17th, 1886, and the firm of James D. Warren’s Sons was thereafter formed, composed of Orsamus G. and Wm. C. Warren, and thus continued to this day.</p><p>Mr. Warren was married October 22nd, 1875, to Elizabeth Griffin, daughter of the late John B. Griffin. Mrs. Warren survives, also four children, three daughters and one son—Gertrude, Helen, Elizabeth, and James D. Warren, Jr.</p><p>Mr. Warren became the successor of his father in Republican political leadership. He was for several years a member of the State Committee, and a delegate to State Conventions. He was a delegate from this district to the National Republican Convention of 1888, and had recently been elected a delegate to the Convention of 1892.</p><p>He was for eight years a member of the Executive Committee of the State Associated Press, and served last year as President of the Association, retiring at the annual meeting held last month in New York.</p><p>Mr. Warren was identified With many large business interests, in addition to his proprietorship of the COMMERCIAL. He was vice-president of the Buffalo Natural Gas Fuel Company, a director of the American Exchange Bank, a trustee of the Buffalo Savings Bank, vice-president of the Depew Improvement Company, and a director of the Bellevue Land Company.</p><p>He was also a member of the Buffalo Club and of the Country Club. Mr. Warren had the reputation of being a far-seeing and remarkably sagacious man of business. In social life he was of a most amiable disposition, and the friends who knew and loved him know best, though they can hardly realize at present, what a loss they have sustained.</p></blockquote><figcaption>

Warren, and their families, an aunt, Miss Sarah Warren, and an uncle on the maternal side, Mr. A. T. Love.</p><p><strong>Editorial Tributes.</strong></p><p>From the Times,</p><p>This community scarcely knew of the dangerous illness of its good friend, Mr. Orsamus George Warren, before the startling announcement of his death brings bereavement to the hearts of all. It is not likely that one tenth of his city friends, who include its entire population, was conscious that this neighbor had passed through quick, painful illness to a release which visits untold loss to hearts and homes—whose special grief none can invade by words—and which terminates choicest associations and kindest relationship with many admiring friends. Mr. Warren’s sad death came this morning at a quarter past nine o’clock. His serious illness began last Saturday. His condition had been critical during every intervening day.</p><p>From the News.</p><p>Orsamus G. Warren, senior proprietor of the BUFFALO COMMERCIAL, died this morning at his home on North street. The news was not unexpected, From midday yesterday his recovery Was pronounced hopeless. The attack of pneumonia under which he was suffering had progressed too far to be successfully controlled. Attempts to feed the lungs with oxygen produced no benefit and later only temporary relief was had from an operation to relieve the organ by blood-letting. Mr. Warren was some better in the evening but failed during the night and passed away soon after 9 o’clock this morning.</p><p>Mr.Warren’s death will be widely lamented. He had, what every earnest and manly man in his position must have, a large circle of friends, and he deserved their kindliest regard. There is more than the conventional tribute to the prominent dead in the earnest words which will be said of him by the press and the public men who knew him. The head of a great newspaper holds a position capable of greater usefulness and of greater harmfulness, perhaps, than any other man in the community. Mr. Warren upheld honorable traditions. He conducted the COMMERCIAL on useful lines. Whatever improvements in presentation of news or in mechanical style were adopted, the dignity and sincerity which characterized it were never lost.</p><p>In his political relations Mr. Warren had the rare success of keeping the esteem of those who differed with him both in and out of his own party. He bore the burden of official party responsibility with moderation and good temper, alike in success and in defeat. He will be remembered in all relations kindly, as a warm friend, a practical, earnest man of affairs and a conservative and tolerant political leader.</p><p>From the Enquirer.</p><p>The death of O. G. Warren is the occasion of profound sorrow in this community. Close upon the news of his serious illness follows the announcement of his death. After a sickness of but a few days he has been called away. The suddenness of his death intensifies the grief of his friends and associates.</p><p>O.G. Warren was a man of many friendships. The shadow of a great sorrow will rest heavily today upon the many who were embraced in the wide circle of his love.</p><p>As editor and as political leader Mr. Warren occupied a conspicuous position. In both capacities he exhibited attributes totally lacking in the ordinary man. He succeeded his father as leader of his party in Western New York. To follow successfully in the footsteps of a man of forceful individuality and of strong purpose, to take up the work and follow the policy outlined by a great leader, require an uncommon capacity for affairs.</p><p>The mantle which fell upon the shoulders of O G. Warren was worthily worn. Especially is this apparent when the changed conditions which the rapid progress of events forced upon him are taken into consideration.</p><p>The life of O..G. Warren was replete with activity. The tireless man of affairs was never idle. He was emphatically a public man. He was in public life from his early manhood until his death.</p><p>Now that he has gone a conscientious judgment will be passed upon his abilities and character. The rivalries of the political forum will not obscure the truth. In that final summary he will appear the skilful leader, the able editor, the true friend, the manly man.</p><p>BUFFALO REPUBLICAN LEAGUE.</p><p>A special meeting of the Buffalo Republican League has been called for Saturday evening at 8 o’clock, to take action on the death of Mr. Warren.</p><p>THE FUNERAL.</p><p>The funeral services will be held on Monday afternoon at 2.30 at the residence on North street.</p><p>It is the desire of the family that no floral offerings be sent.</p></blockquote><figcaption>

In 1878 Mr. Sold his stock to the other partners and in 1880 Mr. Selkreg retired, disposing of his interest to Messrs. Priest and Benjamin, who became sole owners of the property. From 1877 to 1912, 35 years, one-third of the life of this paper, and nearly one-half of his own life span, George E. Priest was editor and part owner of The Ithaca Journal, an important, influential and always helpful figure in Ithaca affairs. Under the editorial direction of Mr. Priest The Journal grew steadily in influence and popularity in this city and county. In the centennial number of this newspaper published in 1915, Mr. Priest said of The Journal that it “has lived this long and thrived because its adherents, the bulk of the people of Ithaca and Tompkins County have deemed it worthy. It has consistently sought under its several publishers to be fair, candid, and progressive.” Never more so then when he was at the helm. … He represented in Ithaca the last of what may be called the journalists of the old school.” (08 Jan 1921, The Ithaca Journal, Ithaca NY, p4, newspapers.com.)</li></ul></div></aside></figure><figure class=image style=max-width:800px><img src=/family-of-edward-hallock-mills/assets/images/mills-family/buffalo/1892-05-06-The-Buffalo-Enquirer-Buffalo-NY-p5_huac5a5423ef465fff0b9edbda95db37b4_1962667_800x500_fill_q75_box_top.jpg width=800 height=500 alt><blockquote><p>O.

The direct cause of death was pneumonia, accompanied by congestion.</p><p>Orsamus George Warren was born in Clarence, Erie County, N. Y., on July 21, 1846. His father was the late James D. Warren, and his mother Laura Love. Passing his childhood days at Clarence, Orsamus’ father did not move into Buffalo to reside until 1854. At that time James D. Warren had just received the office of County Treasurer, which for two terms he held, and in order to facilitate matters he moved into Buffalo, where he and his family made their permanent residence. Little Orsamus was sent to Buffalo Public School No. 14 for three years, and then was placed under tuition at Clarence, where he studied primary classics, and was coached for matriculation at college. He then attended the college at Canandaigua, but his health failing he was sent abroad in the summer of his 17th year. He remained on the continent for 18 months, and studied French classics for six months at the University of Paris, where he creditably acquitted himself. He was nearly 20 years old when, returning to America he entered his father’s office, the <em>Commercial</em>, taking a position in the counting room as a clerk. Here he worked for some time, and after several years of service in this manner, his father rewarded him by a gift of a quarter interest in newspaper.</p><p>The next event of his life was his marriage in 1875 with Miss Elizabeth B. Griffin, daughter of the late John B. Griffin.</p><p>By this marriage they have four children all of whom with the mother survive. They are Gertrude aged 15, James D. aged 14, Helen aged 8, and Elizabeth aged 7. Since his marriage he devoted all his business hours to the Commercial and Republican polities, and at the time of his father’s death succeeded his sire, in partnership with his brother, in the proprietorship of the paper. He was the recognized leader of the Republican party in Erie County and Western New York at one time having been a State Committeeman, and at the recent Republican Convention he was elected as delegate to the Minneapolis Convention. His alternate for this latter honor is Mr. Daniel J. Kenetick.</p><p>HIS LAST ILLNESS,</p><p>Last Thursday evening, a week ago last night, he returned to Buffalo from the Republican Convention at Albany, whither he went from New York city. Friday morning he complained that he had taken a bad chill the day before and was not feeling very well. He went to business, however, but returned before his usual hour in the afternoon and said to his family that he was feeling real miserable. He retired and Dr. Stockton was called. He diagnosed a severe cold and thought that it was nothing dangerous. Saturday found no improvement in the patient and it was given out by his medical adviser that the illness might develop typhoid fever or pneumonia. Still all hoped for the best, and his condition did not grow worse until Wednesday when the dangerous and unmistakable symptoms of pneumonia appeared. Drs. Cary and Rochester were called into consultation by Dr, Stockton. The patient appeared to improve under a slight change of treatment. At 10 o’clock last night the doctors were real hopeful and the patient cheerful. His condition showed a marked change for the better, and there were better grounds for hoping to save him. At midnight the doctors were quite encouraged, and Mr. Warren made a determined struggle.</p><p>“We are bound to make you well,” said Dr, Stockton.</p><p>“And I am bound to get well,” said the patient bravely. He continued to improve until morning approached. At 3 o&rsquo;clock a great change for the worse set in and he began sinking rapidly. Nothing would aid him, and he continued to decline. At 6 o’clock delerium set in, This was the last fatal symptom. The delerium continued at intervals, and at 9:20 he died.</p><p>THE FUNERAL.</p><p>The funeral will take place from his house, of which announcements will be made later. He was in life a staunch member of the First Presbyterian Church, and it is to that religious body that the ceremonies will be entrusted.</p><p>MEETING OF NEWSPAPER MEN.</p><p>President Kingsley of the Buffalo Press Club, of which organization Mr. Warren was au honorary member, has called a special meeting of the club to be held at 4 P. M. tomorrow (Saturday). All newspaper writers are invited lo attend.</p></blockquote><figcaption>

G. WARREN DEAD</p><p>The Editor of the “Commercial” Died This Morning.</p><p>A PEACEFUL END.</p><p>His Physicians Worked Hard to Save His Life, and Resorted to Heroic Methods Without Avail—A Sketch of His Life.</p><p>Mr. Orsamus G, Warren died this morning at 9:30 o&rsquo;clock. The end came peace fully, gently, as though it were the growing unconsciousness of a heavy sleep.</p><p>At noon yesterday Mr. Warren&rsquo;s condition was such that all hope of his recovery was practically given up. Yet the physicians in attendance did not cease the unequal battle. They labored untiringly hoping against hope that there was just the barest chance that they might save their patient&rsquo;s life.</p><p>Oxygen was resorted to and pumped into Mr. Warren’s lungs. In spite of this he continued to grow weaker, and late in the afternoon his condition was such that his death was looked upon as a matter of only a few hours.</p><p>At midnight Mr. Warren seemed to revive and the physicians and the family began to hope that his life might yet be spared. But at 3 o&rsquo;clock another change came, With a gasp, as if seized by the agony of death, he raised his hands feebly and whispered: “Help me!”</p><p>From that moment he became unconscious and sank gradually until 9:15 this morning, when he passed away as if falling asleep.</p><p>His family and the physicians were at the bedside, but the ears of the loving father had for hours been deaf to the sobs of anguish and whispered words of grief and affliction that came from his wife and children.</p><p>It was his first and last serious illness, He had always been an active, robust man, ever ready to do that which would relieve the sufferings of others but knowing little of physical suffering from experience.</p><p>Mr. Warren went to New York the early part of last week on a business mission, and on his way home last Thursday he stopped at Albany to attend the Republican State Convention, to which he was a delegate. At that time he felt tired and overworked, but promised himself a little rest and recuperation on his return home. Nevertheless he took an active part in the proceedings of the convention and remained at Albany until after its adjournment, With the other Buffalo delegates he took the train out of Albany at midnight and arrived in Buffalo early Friday morning.</p><p>He went to his office on Friday, but in the afternoon he was taken with a severe chill, and forced to leave work and go to bed. The symptoms of pneumonia immediately developed. When it was discovered that the illness had taken this turn, the family became greatly alarmed, but the physicians, while considering the case serious, did not admit its hopeless character until yesterday morning. The most approved methods of treatment were tried, including the pumping of oxygen into the lungs, but all without avail. The patient failed to rally. Since the first attack he had been continually sinking, sinking—it was down-hill all the time. His ceaseless activity in business had robbed his constitution of all resistive force. He fell a victim as his father did in December, 1886.</p><p>Orsamus G. Warren was born in the town of Clarence in 1846, and was consequently 46 years of age. He lived and went to school there until 1856, when his father, James D, Warren, was elected County Treasurer, and moved with his family to Buffalo. He then attended School 14 on Franklin street, and later went to the High School, but did not complete his course. He made good use of his opportunities at school and acquired a substantial education. He did not go to college, but on leaving school he entered the office of the <em>Commercial</em>, in which paper his father bought an interest on the 9th of April, 1861.</p><p>About the year 1868 the young man took about a year’s vacation and spent the time traveling in Europe with a party of which James N. Matthews was one. A year or so after his return he took an extended Western trip with John Bullymore and others, visiting numerous points in the Rocky Mountain and Sierra Nevada region. The trip lasted several months.</p><p>On his return he settled down in the <em>Commercial</em> office, and has been active in its affairs and management ever since. Three or four years before his father’s death he became practically the manager of the concern. The senior Warren still visited the office and gave a general direction to affairs, but to his eldest son he committed all the details and executive work, giving him also an interest in the business. The two sous became the sole owners of the newspaper and printing house on the death of their father,</p><p>O. G, Warren was an excellent business man. He received a thorough education in the counting room from his father. He was systematic and had aptitude, discernment and good judgment. He was a director of the American Exchange Bank, and last year was president of the New York Associated Press.</p><p>Though Mr. Warren never held office, and never sought one, he was active in politics and influential in getting places for his friends. He succeeded his father as member of the State Committee from this district and held the place until last fall, when he declined to serve longer, and in his place John N. Scatcherd was elected. Mr. Warren was a delegate to every State convention since his father’s death. While he was on the State Committee he was a member of the Executive Committee. He was a delegate to the National convention of 1888, and a delegate-elect to the convention which is to meet June 7 at Minneapolis.</p><p>He was fond of society and had many warm friends, not only in this city but also throughout the State.</p><p>Mr. Warren leaves a wife who is a daughter of the late John B. Griffin, and four children—one boy and three girls. He is also survived by his only brother, William C. Warren, and by his sisters, Mrs. Isaac Bromley of Hartford. Ct., and Miss Mary Warren of this city.</p><p>Daniel J. Kenefick is Mr. Warren’s alternate, and will therefore be entitled to Mr. Warren&rsquo;s seat in the National Convention.</p></blockquote><figcaption>

O. G. WARREN.</p><p>Action of the East Side Republican League and Other Organizations—The Tribute of the “Commerciai” Employees—The Funeral on Monday.</p><p>ACTION OF “COMMERCIAL” EMPLOYES.</p><p>The employes of the newspaper and book and job printing departments of the Buffalo Commercial held a joint meeting this morning, to take action on the death of their late employer. Mr. George F. Hilbert was elected chairman, and Frank P. Turner secretary. On motion the chair appointed Messrs. Henry W. Dolmage, Jacob Pfohl and Henry E. Hickey a committee on resolutions. The committee presented the following preamble and resolutions, which were unanimously adopted:</p><p>Whereas, Having learned with deep regret of the death of our beloved employer, Orsamus George Warren, we deem it befitting to give expression to our profound sorrow at his untimely demise.</p><p>In the prime of a useful and busy life, with a bright vista before him, the sudden parting of the golden chain of affection that bound us all so closely to him is but another exemplification of the mysterious ways of Providence. It seems but yesterday that we rejoiced in the sunlight of his presence: today we mourn in the inky shadow with which his decease has so suddenly overwhelmed us.</p><p>A just man, an honorable man, he was a noble son of a noble sire. It was a privilege to know him, an honor to be his friend. Of generous, sympathetic nature, he was ever ready to aid by word and deed those who appealed to him for counsel and assistance. Long years of intimate business relations ripened into fraternal regard for him, and his genial, happy disposition will leave a lasting impress upon us whose good fortune it was to serve him.</p><p>In the death of Mr. Warren we have lost a true friend and a kind employer, our appreciation of whose qualities of head and heart we cannot adequately express in words, therefore, be it</p><p>Resolved, that we sincerely mourn his sudden departure from the scene of his earthly labors, cut down in the prime of vigorous life.</p><p>Resolved, That to the bereaved family whom he so dearly loved and whose welfare he so constantly watched, we tender our heartfelt sympathy and condolence, and humbly invoke for them the guardianship of Him who orders all things well.</p><p>Resolved, That a copy of this preamble and these resolutions be engrossed and presented to the family of our deceased friend as a token of our sincere regard for him, and a memento of our sympathy for those whom he held most dear.</p><p>ACTION OF SAVINGS BANE TRUSTEES.</p><p>The Board of Trustees of the Buffalo Savings Bank at a special meeting this forenoon, called to take action upon the death of Orsamus G. Warren, adopted the following memorial:</p><p>A few months ago in seeking among the citizens of Buffalo for one who could worthily fill the place made vacant by the resignation of a valued member of this Board, our choice fell upon Orsamus G. Warren.</p><p>Although he has been associated with us but a short time, we have learned to recognize in him those qualities of mind and character which made him a successful business man, and which enabled him to achieve for himself an honerable position in this community and in the State.</p><p>Actively engaged in political life, his record has been without blemish: at the head of one of the leading daily journals of the country he has kept its columns eminently pure and wholesome, and, under his supervision its utterances have ever been outspoken in the cause of morality and good government.</p><p>He was a conspicuous public man, called by his party and his business associates to high office and places of trust, he always acquitted himself with honor and credit.</p><p>Recognizing in him these characteristics which singularly fitted him for a position of responsibility he was elected a member of this Board last December, in the reasonable hope that the institution committed to our care would have the benefit of his sagacious counsel long after the older members of the Board should have passed away.</p><p>This hope was in vain; in the prime of life; in the vigor of early manhood, and seemingly at the threshold of his greatest usefulness, Orsamus G. Warren has suddenly been summoned from our councils.</p><p>In his death we mourn with the city at large the loss of one who had her best interests at heart and who was active in promoting her growth and prosperity.</p><p>We extend to his friends and business associates our sympathy in the loss they have sustained; and we desire to express to the members of his family our profound grief at the bereavement which has cast its dark shadow over their home.</p><p>In recognition of his worth, and as a lasting testimony to our sorrow, we direct this memorial to be entered upon the minutes of the Board.</p><p>ACTION OF THE EAST SIDE LEAGUE.</p><p>The East Side Republican League adopted the following resolutions last night:</p><p>Resolved, That from an earnest desire to show every mark of respect to the memory of Orsamus G. Warren, late leader of the Republican party of Erie county, and to manifest the high estimate entertained of his eminent services to the Republican party, his distinguished patriotism and his usefulness as a citizen, the business of the East Side Republican League be now suspended, that the friends and associates of deceased may pay fitting tribute to his public and private virtues.</p><p>Resolved, That a widespread and public sorrow on the announcement of his death attested the profound sense of the loss which the whole community has sustained.</p><p>Resolved, That as a mark of respect for the memory of Mr. Orsamus G. Warren, the members of the East Side Republican League do now adjourn.</p><p>MERCHANTS’ EXCHANGE.</p><p>President Scatcherd of the Merchants’ Exchange has appointed Messrs. George Bleistein, George E. Matthews, Edward H. Butler and Norman E. Mack a committee to draft suitable resolutions on the death of Mr. Warren.</p><p>EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE, ASSOCIATED PRESS.</p><p>Syracuse, May 6, 1892.</p><p>The members of the Executive Committee of the New York State Associated Press are requested to meet at the Iroquois Hotel, Buffalo, at 12.30 o’clock Monday to attend the funeral of the late O.

WARREN’S LAST HOURS</p><p>A Quick, Sharp Struggle with Congestion, and when it Was Conquered the Vitality Was Gone—Sweet-Natured and Gentle as a Woman to the End.</p><p>Many who knew Mr. O. G. Warren in life will be interested in knowing how he died—something of the details of the fatal illness that struck him down so quickly in the full flower of his manhood. It is a brief story, the story of a few days, for it was a quick, sharp struggle that was all over almost before it was fully realized that he was dangerously ill.</p><p>The physician in charge of the case furnished the following details this morning:</p><p>Mr. Warren came home last week after a tiresome trip, during which he had spent three nights in a sleeping car, and almost immediately went to the State Convention. On Friday he returned, tired out, exhausted, feeling badly. He went home about noon feeling chilly, unable to get warm.</p><p>His sensations amounted almost to a severe chill. This was followed by fever. The doctor saw him shortly afterwards, and Mr. Warren said he had taken cold at the State convention, and had told ex-Senator McMillan and others that he was taking cold. He told the doctor that he was tired out, wanted some simple remedy and would be all right shortly. The doctor sent him to bed, and gave him some remedies, but the patient did not improve. Saturday morning he felt about the same, though looking badly. Then the doctor gave him a thorough examination. Only fever was found, but it was not a simple fever. The lungs had no bad symptoms whatever at this time. On Sunday the doctor became suspicious of the lungs, but there was no inflammation. Mr. Warren had uneasiness, muscular aches about the chest. On Monday there was still nothing wrong with the lungs; the doctor was watching them very closely.</p><p>Tuesday morning there appeared a consolidation of the upper part of the left lung in the rear. On Wednesday morning this consolidation had involved the whole front part of the left lung, but was not now, strange to say, noticeable in the posterior portion. All this time there had been a moderate fever. Mr. Warren, up to this time, had not felt really ill, only uncomfortable.</p><p>He had a fairly comfortable day Wednesday, but on Wednesday night there was trouble with congestion of the right lung, though the inflammation was confined to the left lung. In fact, at no time during the progress of the disease did the inflammation extend beyond the font part of the left lung. There was, however, a great deal of congestion, and from this time on there was a constant fight against congestion.</p><p>Wednesday night was troubled, and on Thursday morning it was seen that Mr. Warren was very dangerously ill. He was very much prostrated. His mind was occasionally obscured. He looked at times during the day as if he could not survive more than a few hours. But the grim fight went on. The dread congestion would be fought back, would come again suddenly, would be controlled by treatment, and would again and again return. The whole fight was against congestion. Every reasonable device that medical skill could suggest and money procure was brought into requisition. This was the critical time in the disease, and finally, towards night of Thursday, it looked as if death had been beaten back; at least there was more room for hope than there had been at any time since the severity of the disease became apparent. Mr. Warren felt considerably relieved. He was breathing better, his lungs were mere free than they had been for 24 hours. The congestion seemed to be conquered.</p><p>Then came the struggle for life, with all the poison of the disease upon one side and a weak vitality upon the other. It was a question of vitality now, of power to shake off death’s clutches, and the vitality was fearfully low.</p><p>The struggle continued until 8 o’clock Friday morning, when a change came; it was the beginning of the end. The nervous system became disturbed, there was general nervous failure, the system did not respond to stimulants. With the general failure came a return of the congestion, and it could not be removed. The patient could not be rallied. The vitality was too low. It very soon became apparent that the congestion could not be removed and that the fatal time was approaching. Mr. Warren’s consciousness was obscured from the moment the change came, becoming more and more obscured as his life ebbed away. There was very little suffering. From 4 0’clock he was gradually wearing out. He died at 9 o’clock on Friday morning, his unconsciousness merging painlessly and almost imperceptibly into death.</p><p>It was not an instance of severe pneumonia. Hundreds have recovered from an attack quite as severe, but in Mr. Warren’s case the disease came at an unfortunate time, when he was tired out, and had little reserve force.</p><p>One remarkable thing much noticed by those about his bedside was his unfailing kindness and thoughtfulness for them, even when he was in extremis. Many women act so in sickness, but men rarely. Men are wont to be impatient, petulant, when confined to a sickbed; women are gentler, more patient. The sweetness of Mr. Warren’s nature was with him to the end. He was kind, thoughtful, grateful for attentions, and was cheerful, hopeful and courageous in all the conscious hours of his sickness. The attending physician said he had never seen a man in extremity bear himself with so much gentleness and consideration for those about him.</p><p>And in this, those who knew him best, know as he died as he had lived, for no one had warmer sympathies or kinder heart.</p><p>WILL CLOSE AT NOON.</p><p>Owing to the funeral of Mr. Warren, the office of the Buffalo Natural Gas Fuel Company, of which he was vice-president, will close at noon on Monday.</p><p>ACTION OF THE MERCHANTS’ EXCHANGE.</p><p>A meeting of the Merchants’ Exchange was called for noon today to take action on the death of Mr. Warren. Amongst those present were:</p><p>President Scatcherd, Vice-president W. C. Newman, George Urban, Jr., George E. Matthews, General P. C. Doyle, Norman E. Mack, Conway W. Ball, Edward W. Eames, George Sandrock, G. H. Wolcott, Leonard Dodge, N.C. Simons, S. S. Brown, P. A. Rosseel, Daniel E. Newhall, Frederick Truscott, Charles F. Sternberg, Alanson Morse, Riley E. Pratt, Thomas J. O’Brien, Francis E Shepherd, F. J. Sawyer, Sidney H. Finn, Willis C. Jacus, Harris Fesbinder, James Devine, William F. O’Roorke, Wm. G. Heathfield, &c., &c.</p><p>The unusual hush over the Exchange prior to the meeting showed how deep and general was the sympathy with the departed member’s family and the grief for the loss of an old member of the body. When President Scatcherd called the meeting to order there was a very large attendance. He said:</p><p>“Gentlemen. It becomes my painful duty today to announce the death of Orsamus G. Warren, born July 21st, 1846, died May 6th, 1892. In accordance with the custom of the Exchange I have ordered a committee to draw up resolutions upon the death of Mr. Warren. That committee consisted of Norman E. Mack, E. H. Butler, George Bleistein, and George E. Matthews. I will now ask Mr. Matthews to read the resolution:</p><p>Mr. Matthews said he desired, on the part of the committee, to submit the following memorial and resolution:</p><p>“In the death of Orsamus G. Warren the Merchants’ Exchange loses a member who was ever alert to the importance of organized effort, and ever ready by word and deed to assist in everything tending to the upbuilding of our local institutions and the onward march of Buffalo as a great and growing commercial center.</p><p>His death is a loss to the city at large because of his eminent respectability in public and private life; his high standing as the head of a newspaper whose influence for good is known and respected in all sections of the state and country.</p><p>To his family, relatives and associates in business we extend our deepest sympathies, assuring them that we share the sorrow and bear in part this burden of grief, a grief which is felt throughout the city and state. All who knew him regret the sudden call and summons which removed him from the busy field of labor and honest endeavor to the reward he so justly earned and so faithfully strove for.</p><p>Resolved, That this memorial minute be spread upon the minutes and a copy signed by the President, Secretary and members of the committee be forwarded to the widow of our late beloved friend and associate.</p><p>NORMAN E. MACK,</p><p>E. H. BUTLER,</p><p>GEO. BLEISTEIN,</p><p>GEO. E. MATTHEWS, Committee.</p><p>The memorial and, resolution were agreed to and the meeting terminated.</p><p>Resolutions by the Republican Committee.</p><p>It was not a very cheerful gathering in the Republican committee rooms this afternoon, when the Republican Executive Committee—political comrades of O. G. Warren—met to take action upon his death. It was a sad task.</p><p>George Urban presided. A motion was carried that Messrs. R. R. Hefford, Harvey J. Hurd, Ossian Bedell and William B. Sirret be appointed a committee with Chairman Urban to wdraw up appropriate resolutions. The following resolutions were reported and adopted:</p><p>The Republican Executive Committee, in special meeting assembled, while mournfully bowing to the Almighty decree which has removed from us our late esteemed and much beloved friend and leader, O. G. Warren, desire to pay a last tribute of respect to his ability as a leader, his loyalty to and sturdy support of republican principles, worth as a man.</p><p>Twice within recent years the republican party of Erie county has been called upon to mourn the loss of trusted leaders. In 1886 James D. Warren, for years the recognized and successful head of the party in Western New York, laid down the sceptre, which by common consent, was taken up by his son Orsamus G., who has skilfully wielded it for the past six years.</p><p>In the death of O. G. Warren the party loses a leader of sterling worth and rare ability for organization, an excellent judge of human nature, and a man of unlimited energy. Although giving to politics much thought and effort, it was not in the hope of personal advancement or profit. His was an unselfish devotion to the principles of the party he had espoused. Never seeking office or pecuniary reward, he labored for Republican success with a zeal that knew no bounds.</p><p>O. G. Warren was peculiarly a man of the people, always approachable, and recognizing worth when hidden under the garb of a working man as readily as when clothed in broadcloth, and hundreds of the republican rank and file mourn his loss today with unfeigned sorrow, because of valuable services rendered.</p><p>In his loyalty to friends he was stalwart and true, many times suffering undeserved criticism and condemnation, because of his steadfast, unswerving adherence to friends with whom he was associated.</p><p>Resolved, That in the death of O. G. Warren the members of this Committee feel that they have lost a near, dear and sturdy friend; the party, an energetic, skillful and unselfish leader; that an earnest and powerful advocate and defender of republican principles and sound republican doctrine has fallen by the way; that the community has lost a valued member and humanity a whole-souled, manly man.</p><p>Resolved, That this Committee on behalf of the Republican party of Western New York extend to the widow and bereaved family our heartfelt sympathy and condolence in this hour of their terrible affliction, and hope that they may be sustained and comforted by higher than human power.</p><p>Resolved, That an engrossed copy of these resolutions be transmitted to the widow of the deceased, that, as an outward evidence of the sorrow that fills our hearts, these rooms he properly draped in mourning, and that this committee attend the funeral in a body.</p><p>Walter J. Shepard, Thomas T. Ramsdell and William B. Sirret spoke, and paid most feeling and eloquent tributes to the memory of Mr. Warren.</p><p>FROM MR. BAILEY. RICHFIELD SPRINGS, N.Y., May 7.</p><p>William C. Warren, COMMERCIAL, Buffalo:</p><p>It adds to the pangs of a painful illness which banishes me here that I cannot be at the funeral on Monday, but if I cannot see your brother&rsquo;s still face can I remember it never unresponsive to me.</p><p>E. PRENTISS BAILEY.</p><p>FROM MR. HENDRICKS. SYRACUSE, N. Y., May 7.</p><p>Wm. C. Warren, Buffalo:</p><p>I desire to express my sincere sympathy with yourself and the family of Mr. Warren in your great bereavement.</p><p>FRANCIS HENDRICKS.</p><p>From the Elmira Advertiser.</p><p>The regret and sorrow with which the journalistic fraternity of New York learn of the death of Mr. Warren of the BUFFALO COMMERCIAL cannot be overestimated. Although not an editor he was one of the best and best known newspaper men in the state. He came to his work by inheritance after a long training under his able and lamented father, the late James D. Warren. He followed wisely and well in the paternal footsteps and developed executive ability and wisdom in journalism which had few equals in the state.</p><p>Mr. Warren&rsquo;s personal qualities were of the highest order and his friends were numbered by the number of those who were thrown in contact with him. He was modest, genial, considerate, independent, honest, brave and frank. No one ever doubted his word or failed to rely upon his promises. Naturally, then, being deeply interested in politics, he grew to be a power in the Republican party of Western New York. The mantle of his noble father fell upon him in this regard and the trust was well fulfilled. The COMMERCIAL, under his guidance, was the exponent of the best Republican sentiment as it was a representative of the highest standards of able, clean, helpful and elevating journalism. His service to his party was not limited to the influence of his newspaper, but his work in county and state committees was of the greatest benefit.</p><p>The members of the New York State Associated Press especially feel a sense of personal less in Mr. Warren’s death. For many years he served as one of the executive committee of the association and two years ago he was unanimously elected to the presidency of that body. It was during his term of office that several of the great improvements made in the matter and manner of news service were instituted. The writer of this inadequate tribute to Mr. Warren&rsquo;s character, ability and service to the people of the State speaks with the knowledge that comes from life-long acquaintance with him. They were born in the same little village of Erie county and their boyhood training was gained in the same school. In later years their relations with each other in journalism, in the republican state committee and in the associated press have increased and strengthened the appreciation which the writer, long ago, had reason to feel of the noble, personal qualities of Orsamus G. Warren.</p><p>From the Newburg Journal.</p><p>Mr. O. G. Warren, senior proprietor of the BUFFALO COMMERCIAL, died this morning after a short illness, in his forty-sixth year. By his death the newspaper press of the State loses one of its ablest, most alert and energetic members, and the Republican party one of its devoted and hard-working adherents. Mr. Warren has long been a member of the Associated Press of the State of New York, was at one time its President, and ever since he became a member has been influential in its councils. The vacancy caused by his death will not easily be filled. As a Republican Mr. Warren wielded a wide influence in the party in the Western part of the State.</p><p>Utica Herald.</p><p>In every relation of life Mr. Warren won and held the liking and confidence of the men with whom he came in contact. He was always sincere, true to his convictions and steadfast in the purposes to which his judgment or pledges committed him. The death of such a man is a public loss. In the newspaper offices of the State a sense of personal bereavement is experienced, for Mr. Warren&rsquo;s active part in the administration of affairs of the Associated Press made his name as familiar as that of an immediate associate. Sympathies of a host of sincere friends will go out to the loving and most interesting home circle, on which this unutterable grief has fallen with stunning suddenness.</p><p>Brooklyn Eagle.</p><p>Orsaimus G. Warren, leading proprietor of the BUFFALO COMMERCIAL, is dead. He was a son of James D, Warren, long time the owner and conductor of that excellent republican newspaper, and he resembled his honored father in many respects. The sad event occurred this morning. It is a complete surprise to many press and personal friends. Mr. O. G. Warren made his summer home at Shelter Island. Many Brooklynites there learned to know and like him well. He was a thorough journalist, a fair partisan, an influential member of his party’s state committee and an excellent and able man in every personal, civic and business relation.</p><p>Watertown Times.</p><p>In the death of O.G. Warren, of the BUFFALO COMMERCIAL, the state press has lost one of its most valuable members. He was an active, live publisher, young and enthusiastic, and not only made his own newspaper a great success but he was an inspiration to the newspaper press of the state. He was the most active, moving force in the state associated press and last year was its president. Every newspaper office in the state will feel that it has meta personal loss in his death. Mr.Warren like his father, James D. Warren, was active and influential in local and state politics. No young man in this state will be more missed. He had the largest circle of acquaintances, and every one felt a personal friendship for him because he was a genial, pleasant friend to all. He had rare executive talents, and in whatever engaged, in business or political affairs, he was a leader whose advice was always listened to, and an organizer who never failed of success.</p><p>From the Syracuse Courier.</p><p>In the death of O. G. Warren of the Buffalo COMMERCIAL Buffalo loses one of her most prominent and influential citizens, and journalism one of its ablest and most respected members. He was energetic and active, and a most valuable and influential official. A genial and courteous gentleman, he was highly esteemed by all who knew him, and his friends throughout the state were legion. He was a man of pronounced opinions and a stalwart Republican, and his paper was under his able management a model journal.</p><p>Utica Press.</p><p>Yesterday O. G. Warren died at his home in the city of Buffalo, after a brief illness. In politics he was a republican and was one of that party’s active men in this state. The deceased was a man of first-class ability and was successful in whatever he undertook. By those who knew him personally, he was highly esteemed and many have benefited by his substantial favors. His death will be sincerely regretted throughout the state.</p><p>From the Jamestown News.</p><p>Mr. Warren was a republican of the intense school. In his family and social relations Mr. Warren was an hospitable and agreeable gentleman, and one who enjoyed the respect and confidence of a large circle of friends. The journalism of Buffalo is a distinct loser by his death.</p><p>From the Syracuse Standard.</p><p>New York State journalism is in mourning today for a man who carried into it enthusiasm and brilliancy. O. G. Warren, editor of the BUFFALO COMMERCIAL, was a man of superior attainments and honest impulses. His death is an untoward event, the poignancy of which can be measured only by those who were most intimate with him in his work and in his leisure.</p></blockquote><figcaption>

Kingsley of the Press Club, a large number of active members of the press of Buffalo assembled at the club rooms yesterday afternoon to give expression to the professional sentiment regarding the lamented death of the senior proprietor and editor of the <em>Commercial</em>, Orsamus G. Warren.</p><p>President Kingsley stated the purpose of the gathering in a few remarks, in which he alluded to the universal feeling among the newspaper men of the city that they had lost a true friend and one whose character and accomplishments were such as had done honor to journalism.</p><p>Mark Bennett, editor of the <em>Times</em>, Charles A, White of the <em>News</em>, and George Ferris of the <em>Courier</em>, were appointed as a committee on resolutions:</p><p>George E. Matthews, proprietor of the <em>Express</em>, spoke of the life and death of his early and long-time friend, Mr. Warren, with manifestly deep feeling. There could be no more sincere tribute to the virtues, talents and kindness of heart of the deceased gentleman.</p><p>Edwin Fleming, the editor of the COURIER, also addressed the meeting feelingly, saying he had known Mr. Warren as a frank, straight-forward, sagacious man of uncommonly tenacious purpose, optimistic as such tenacious men are apt to be, cheerful, full of hopefulness, always courteous and cordial. No partisan newspaper controversy was so spirited or violent as to dull this courtesy, this cordiality. It was especially fitting that the newspaper workers should gather to pay tribute to one who had so many sterling qualities of head and heart.</p><p>Norman E. Mack, proprietor of the <em>Times</em>, paid tribute to Mr. Warren as a loyal friend and useful citizen, whose death was a public misfortune.</p><p>The committee then submitted their report, as follows:</p><p>The Buffalo Press Club had hoped to be spared for many years the record of death which this day compels.</p><p>Orsamus G. Warren’s great activity and well balanced energies conveyed the constant assurance of many added years of usefulness of successes further to bless, his family and all with whom associations could not fail to benefit.</p><p>This Club speaks with gratitude of Mr. Warren&rsquo;s active relations with this fraternity and in appreciation of his abiding interest and thoughtfulness for its well-being. He was proud of the newspaper as an institution and was zealous in advancing its standard and promoting its influence for good. His advice to those with whom he was associated was ever a counseling to better endeavor. His friendship was something to be highly prized and sacredly preserved. His qualities of mind and heart were understood only to be admired. The impress of his example will be one of enduring force upon the press of this city and State.</p><p>Words are indeed inadequate to express the emotions of sorrow that we feel or the deep sympathy we have for those who were nearest to him in the holy relations of the home. We have lost a good friend and safe adviser and his memory we shall ever revere.</p><p>It is directed that this tribute be spread-upon the records of this club and that copies hereof be sent to Mr. Warren&rsquo;s family and to the newspapers of Buffalo.</p><p>Arthur W,. Austin, city editor of the <em>Commercial</em>, on behalf of the staff of that paper, spoke a beautifully worded and effective eulogium of their departed chief, after which the resolutions were adopted.</p><p>Action of the Merchants’ Exchange.</p><p>The prominent business men of Buffalo were largely represented at a special meeting held on ’Change yesterday at noon. President J. N. Scateherd presided, A committee consisting of Norman E. Mack, E. H. Butler, George E. Matthews and George Bleistein, had been previously appointed by him to draft a memorial for Mr. Warren. Their report, presented by Mr. Matthews and unanimously adopted, spoke of the deceased as “a member who was ever alive to the importance of organized effort, and ever ready by word and deed to assist in everything tending to the upbuilding of our local institutions and the onward march of Buffalo as a great and growing commercial center.”</p><p>Action of Buffalo Savings Bank Trustees.</p><p>The Board of Trustees of the Buffalo Sayings Bank at a special meeting yesterday forenoon, called to take action upon the death of Orsamus G. Warren, adopted the following memorial:</p><p>A few months ago in seeking among the citizens of Buffalo for one who could worthily fill the place made vacant by the resignation of a valued member of this Board, our choice fell upon Osamus G. Warren.</p><p>Although he has been associated with us but a short time, we have learned to recognize in him those qualities of mind and character which made him a successful business man, and which enabled him to achieve for himself an honorable position in this community and in the State.</p><p>Actively engaged in political life, his record has been without blemish; at the head of one of the leading daily journals of the country, he has kept its columns eminently pure and wholesome, and under his supervision its utterances have ever been outspoken in the cause of morality and good government.</p><p>He was a conspicuous public man, called by his party and his business associates to high office and places of trust, he always acquitted himself with honor and credit.</p><p>Recognizing in him those characteristics which singularly fitted him for a position of responsibility, he was elected a member of this Board last December, in the reasonable hope that the institution committed to our care would have the benefit of his sagacious counsel long after the older members of the Board should have passed away.</p><p>This hope was in vain; in the prime of life, in the vigor of early manhood, and seemingly at the threshold of his greatest usefulness, Orsamus G. Warren has suddenly been summoned from our councils.</p><p>In his death we mourn with the city at large the loss of one who had her best interest at heart and who was active in promoting her growth and prosperity.</p><p>We extend to his friends and business associates our sympathy in the loss they have sustained; and we desire to express to the members of his family our profound grief at the bereavement which has cast its dark shadow over their home.</p><p>In recognition of his worth, and as a lasting testimony to our sorrow, we direct this memorial to be entered upon the minutes of the Board.</p><p>Action of the Republican Committee.</p><p>George Urban presided at a meeting of the Republican Executive Committee yesterday afternoon. R. R. Hefford, Harvey J. Hurd, and Ossian Dedell as a committee submitted memorial resolutions. These set forth that in the death of Mr. Warren the party lost a leader of sterling worth and rare ability for organization, an excellent judge of human nature, and a man of unlimited energy. Although giving to politics much thought and effort, it was not in the hope of personal advancement or profit. He was peculiarly a man of the people, always approachable, and recognizing worth when hidden under the garb of a workingman as readily as when clothed in broadcloth.</p><p>Eloquent tributes to Mr. Warren’s worth were given by Walter J. Shepard, Thomas T. Ramsdell, and William B. Sirret.</p><p>Action of the Republican League.</p><p>A meeting of the Republican League last evening was largely attended, President Scatcherd in the chair. George S. Howe, E. C. Volger, and C. K.

The president, Mr. John A. Scatcherd, filled the chair. In calling the meeting to order and explaining its purpose he spoke simply and impressively of Mr. Warren, of the respect and regard in which he had learned to hold him, and of the loyalty and depth of his character. Messrs. Arthur W. Hickman, Martin Clark, Judge E. W. Hatch and N. S. Rosenau followed in brief remarks speaking sympathetically of Mr. Warren&rsquo;s high character and of his service to party and community. The following resolutions drafted by a committee composed of Messrs. George S. Hull, Charles K. Robinson and Edward C. Volger, were adopted:</p><p>Whereas, We of the Buffalo Republican League feel that by the sudden death of the Hon. Orsamus G. Warren, in the very prime of a life, full of splendid achievement and rich promise, a man valued and trusted in the councils of the great party to which we owe allegiance, beyond any of his townsmen, the community has sustained a deep and memorable loss, and we are deprived of the advice and assistance of one of our most prominent associate members;</p><p>Resolved, That we express the feeling of appreciation for his life and work which must animate us as we recall his many services, as a citizen and a statesman, to the State and Nation, but more particularly to this city, which he loved as his home. While we know that he has so identified himself with her history that his name will be carried to future generations whenever the tale of her development be told, and that it needs no formal tribute to keep his memory green in the minds of those who live today, we would express our admiration for his genius and those rare qualities of mind and character which fitted him by nature for the position of leadership which so long he held; and we would extend our sincere sympathy to his bereaved family and those who are more nearly called to mourn. To this end it is directed that these resolutions be spread upon the minutes of the League.</p><p>BY THE REPUBLICAN COMMITTEE.</p><p>At a meeting of the Republican Executive Committee, held yesterday afternoon to take action upon Mr. Warren&rsquo;s death, it was moved and carried that a committee of five should be appointed, of which the chair should be one, to draft resolutions. Chairman Urban appointed Messrs. Hefford, Hurd, Sirret, and Bedell. Brief speeches, embodying tributes to Mr. Warren&rsquo;s memory, were made by Messrs. Hefford, Ramsdell and Sirret. The committee decided to attend the funeral in a body and will meet for the purpose at 2 o&rsquo;clock tomorrow afternoon. The following resolutions were adopted:</p><p>The Republican Executive Committee in special meeting assembled, while mournfully bowing to the Almighty&rsquo;s decree which has removed from us our late esteemed and much beloved friend and leader, O. G. Warren, desire to pay a last tribute of respect to his ability as a leader, his loyalty to and sturdy support of Republican principles, and his worth as a man. Twice within recent years the Republican party of Erie County has been called upon to mourn the loss of trusted leaders. In 1886, James D. Warren, for years the recognized and successful head of the party in Wester New York, laid down the sceptor, which, by common consent, was taken up by his son Orsamus G., who has skillfully wielded it for the past six years. In the death of O. G. Warren the party loses a leader of sterling worth and rare ability for organization, an excellent judge of human nature, and a man of unlimited energy. Although giving to politics much thought and effort, it was not in the hope of personal advancement or profit. His was an unselfish devotion to the principles of the party he had espoused. Never seeking office or pecuniary reward, he labored for Republican success with a zeal that knew no bounds. O. G. Warren was peculiarly a man of the people, always approachable and recognizing worth when hidden under the garb of a workingman as readily as when clothed in broadcloth; and hundreds of Republican rand and file mourn his loss today with unfeigned sorrow, because of valuable services rendered. In his loyalty to friends he was stalwart and true, many times suffering undeserved criticism and condemnation because of his steadfast, unswerving adherence to friends with whom he associated.</p><p>Resolved, That in the death of O. G. Warren, the members of this committee feel that they have lost a near, dear and sturdy friend; the party an energetic, skillful, and unselfish leader; than an earnest and powerful advocate and defender of Republican principles and sound Republican doctrine has fallen by the way; that the community has lost a valued member and humanity a whole-souled, manly man.</p><p>Resolved, That this committee, on behalf of the Republican party of Wester New York, extends to the widow and bereaved family our heartfelt sympathy and condolence in this hour of their terrible affliction, and hope that they may be sustained and comforted by higher than human power.</p><p>Resolved, That an engrossed copy of these resolutions be transmitted to the widow of the deceased, and that, as an outward evidence of the sorrow that fills our hearts, these rooms be properly draped in mourning, and that this committee attend the funeral in a body.</p><p>BY THE MERCHANTS&rsquo; EXCHANGE.</p><p>At a meeting of the Merchants&rsquo; Exchange held yesterday morning, the following was adopted on report of the committee, Messrs. Norman E. Mack, E. H. Butler, George Bleistein and George E. Matthews:</p><p>In the death of Orsamus G. Warren the Merchants&rsquo; Exchange loses a member who was ever alert to the importance of organized effort and ever ready by word and deed to assist in everything tending to the upbuilding of our local institutions and the onward march of Buffalo as a great and growing commercial center.</p><p>His death is a loss to the city at large because of his eminent respectability in public and private life; his high standing as the head of a newspaper whose influence for good is known and respected in all sections of the State and country.</p><p>To his family, relatives and associates in business we extend our deepest sympathies, assuring them that we share the sorrow and bear in part this burden of grief which is felt throughout the city and State. All who know him regret the sudden call and summons which removed him from the busy field of labor and honest endeavor to the reward he so justly earned and so faithfully strove for.</p><p>Resolved; That this memorial minute be spread upon the minutes and a copy signed by the president, secretary and members of the committee be forwarded to the widow of our late beloved friend and associate.</p><p>BY THE &ldquo;COMMERCIAL&rdquo; EMPLOYEES.</p><p>The employees of the newspaper and book and job-printing departments of the <em>Commercial</em> adopted the following resolutions at a joint meeting yesterday:</p><p>Whereas, Having learned with deep regret of the death of our beloved employer, Orsamus George Warren, we deem it befitting to give expression to our profound sorrow at his untimely demise. In the prime of a useful and busy life, with a bright vista before him, the sudden parting of the golden chain of affection that bound us all so closely to him is but another exemplification of the mysterious ways of Providence. It seems but yesterday that we rejoiced in the sunlight of his presence; today we mourn in the inky shadow with which his decease has so suddenly overwhelmed us. A just man, an honorable man, he was a noble son of a noble sire. It was a privilege to know him, an honor to be his friend. Of generous, sympathetic nature, he was ever ready to aid by word and deed those who appealed to him for counsel and assistance. Long years of intimate business relations ripened into fraternal regard for him, and his genial, happy disposition will leave a lasting impress upon us whose good fortune it was to serve him. In the death of Mr. Warren we have lost a true friend and a kind employer, our appreciations of whose qualities of head and heart we cannot adequately express in words: therefore, be it</p><p>Resolved, That we sincerely mourn his sudden departure from the scene of his early labors, cut down in the prime of vigorous life.</p><p>Resolved, That to the bereaved family whom he so dearly loved and whose welfare he so constantly watched, we tender our heartfelt sympathy and condolence, and humbly invoke for them the guardianship of Him who orders all things well.</p><p>Resolved, That a copy of this preamble and these resolutions be engrossed and presented to the family of our deceased friend as a token of our sincere regard for him and a memento of our sympathy for those whom he held most dear.</p><p>BY THE TRUSTEES OF THE BUFFALO SAVINGS BANK.</p><p>The trustees of the Buffalo Savings Bank adopted the following memorial upon the death of Mr. Warren, who was their fellow member, at a special meeting yesterday forenoon:</p><p>A few months ago, in seeking among the citizens of Buffalo for one who could worthily fill the place made vacant by the resignation of a valued member of this board, our choice fell upon Orsamus G. Warren.</p><p>Although he has been associated with us but a short time, we have learned to recognize in him those qualities of mind and character which made him a successful business-man, and which enabled him to achieve for himself an honorable position in this community and in the State. Actively engaged in political life, his record has been without blemish; at the head of one of the leading daily journals of the country, he has kept its columns eminently pure and wholesome, and under his supervision its utterances have ever been outspoken in the cause of morality and good government. He was a conspicuous public man. Called by his party and his business associates to high office and places of trust, he always acquitted himself with honor and credit.</p><p>Recognizing in him these characteristics which singularly fitted him for a position of responsibility, he was elected a member of this board last December, in the reasonable hope that the institution committed to our care would have the benefit of his sagacious counsel long after the older members of the board should have passed away.</p><p>This hope was in vain. In the prime of his life, in the vigor of early manhood, and seemingly at the threshold of his greatest usefulness, Orsamus G. Warren has suddenly been summoned from our councils.</p><p>In his death we mourn with the city at large the loss of one who had her best interests at heart and who was active in promoting her growth and prosperity.</p><p>We extend to his friends and business associates our sympathy in the loss they have sustained; and we desire to express to the members of his family our profound grief at the bereavement which has cast its dark shadow over their home.</p><p>In recognition of his worth, and as a lasting testimony to our sorrow, we direct this memorial to be entered upon the minutes of the board.</p></blockquote><figcaption>

A detailed sketch of Mr. Warren’s life appeared in THE EXPRESS yesterday: but because of the greater circulation of THE ILLUSTRATED EXPRESS we republish from yesterday&rsquo;s issue the editorial estimate of Mr. Warren&rsquo;s character, and append the following biographical data: Mr. Orsamus G. Warren died at his home in this city on Friday, the 6th inst. His illness, which was of less than a week&rsquo;s duration, resulted from a severe cold which he took when comings home from the recent Republican State Convention at Albany, and Was diagnosed as lobar pneumonia.</p><p>Mr. Warren was widely known as the successor of his father, the late James D. Warren, as chief proprietor of the Buffalo Commercial, and as a political leader. He was for several years a member of the Republican State Committee and a delegate to State Conventions. He was a delegate from this district to the National Republican Convention of 1888, and had recently been elected a delegate to the Convention of 1892. He was for eight years a member of the Executive Committee of the State Associated Press, and served last year as president of the association, retiring at the annual meeting held last month in New York.</p></blockquote><figcaption>

But of these things others, with whom he worked until he fell, spent and exhausted, may speak.” The COMMERCIAL’S columns, filled with loving, admiring and sincere tributes to Mr. Warren’s character, kindliness, and worth as a man and citizen have since then testified more effectively than could any words of ours how large and honorable a place our friend and chief filled in this city and in this commonwealth. These proofs of the peculiarly affectionate regard in which Mr. Warren was held by the busy men of the press, of the exchange, of the bank; by his party colleagues, his political opponents and a multitude of friends who had learned to like and trust him, are very gratefully appreciated by his family and his associates, and will be a precious heritage to his children.</p><p>Today our friend will be laid at rest. On the day he gave up and went home—one week ago last Friday—he said to a friend in the office: “I am tired out. I&rsquo;m going home and shall not come back until I am rested.” He will not come back. He is at rest—and may God rest his brave soul!</p><figure>
<pre>
He turned his head,—beside him stood 
  A man whose face was pale but fair; 
Whose quiet eyes like starlight shone 
  From out his dark and misty hair: 
    “Thy prayer is heard,” he said. 
<br>
“But thou art Death,—thy name is writ 
  Upon thy still and smileless face,— 
I prayed tor peace,—why art thou here? 
  What bringeth thee to seek this place? 
    I prayed for peace,” he said. 
<br>
“Thy prayer is heard,” the angel said,  
  “Men pray for peace, yet Death would shun, 
Not seeing, with their blinded eyes, 
  That Death and Peace are ever one. 
    Thy prayer is heard,” he said. 
</pre></figure><p>MORE EDITORIAL TRIBUTES.</p><p>Warm and Appreciative Expressions from Mr. Warren’s Friends of the State Press.</p><p>From the Utica Observer.</p><p>This comes close! Death strikes very near! It uncloses a hand-clasp right here!</p><p>Quickly has walked our friend out of familiar scenes and to be forevermore among the silent. A fortnight ago he was with the principal newspaper men of the State in annual meeting in New York, presiding over them, active, persuasive, useful; last week in Albany at the Republican State Convention, a leader among leaders, zealous and hopeful, and taking a commission to the National Convention at Minneapolis; at home again this week, smiling ready answer to ready welcome; then stricken, and after a few brief hours gone!</p><p>These three references to his recent movements hint at the things he was, the things he loved, the things he did in life—outside of his home. First he was a newspaperman. He came up to that estate by his father’s side—by the side of a rare father, for such was James D. Warren—who inducted his son successively into journalism of an admirable sort, then into politics, and transferred to him at death the mantle of undisputed leadership in the County of Erie, and concurrently placed upon his shoulders and in his hands the responsibilities and substance of accumulated wealth and the open opportunities of enhancing it. The years can be counted on one’s fingers since the most of this came to O. G. Warren. He pushed on the newspaper, the BUFFALO COMMERCIAL to increased deserving in public estimation; he held the attachment of the party as his father had done; and he was singularly fortunate in investments coupled to Buffalo’s growth and the promotion of it, so that he lays down a fortune larger than that which fell to his brother and himself at a date comparatively recent.</p><p>To have done so much, to have filled spheres so important and filled them so well, and yet not to have reached his 46th birthday, forms a record of achievement and possession such as few acquire.</p><p>The best of it was that a young heart and strong attachments and open ways went with it all, helped it all, were potent elements in it all. And here is the secret of friendships that bleed today wherever Orsamus George Warren was known.</p><p>From the Buffalo Sunday Truth.</p><p>In his relation towards the public as head of a great organ of public opinion, it is difficult to speak too highly of Mr. Warren. He aimed at producing a clean, family newspaper and a fair political one, while in the collection of legitimate news he ever sought to stimulate the best efforts of the staff to whom its general conduct was confided. The COMMERCIAL has always been on the right side of progressive public movements. Every good cause has had its aid. It has preached the straight republican faith at all times, always accepting the dictum of the councils of the party, and sinking its own preferences at times in its loyalty to the whole body. Such unwavering loyalty is as difficult as the declaring of independence, but it was the only sort that Mr. Warren could comprehend.</p><p>As a party leader he sacrificed himself without stint. Seeking nothing for himself, he gave his time and money freely to advance the interests of the cause in which he believed. His last political work was of a pacificatorv character, trying to weld together the two wings of the republicanism of Erie county for united action in the great campaign of the year.</p><p>A high principled man, blameless in every relation of life, Orsamus G. Warren will go to the grave sincerely mourned by all who know how to appreciate manly worth.</p><p>From the Rochester Post-Express.</p><p>Orsamus G. Warren in all the widely different fields of his activity displayed such ability and was so courteous and kind that the number of his friends equalled the number of those who knew him.</p><p>There were many who differed from Mr. Warren in politics and he had some sharp competitors in business; but all of them admired and respected him, and are now paying the sincerest tributes to his memory. In his death Buffalo loses an estimable and popular citizen—one who labored unceasingly to increase the prosperity and extend its reputation—and our esteemed contemporary the Buffalo COMMERCIAL, loses the honored chief who advanced it to the very front rank of afternoon newspapers.</p><p>From the New York Press.</p><p>Mr. O. G. Warren of the BUFFALO COMMERCIAL, who died in that city after a brief illness yesterday, succeeded his father, who was an eminent republican, in the principal ownership and editorship of that leading Western New York newspaper about seven years ago. He was a man of warm attachment to friends, and was the recognized republican leader in Erie county at the time of his death.</p><p>From the Buffalo Real Estate News.</p><p>In the death of Orsamus G. Warren, senior proprietor of the Buffalo COMMERCIAL, this city loses a business man and political leader of marked ability. Mr.Warren has been a hard worker in his business of managing a newspaper and was doubtless iily prepared to combat so dangerous a disease as typhoid pneumonia with which he was stricken. The life work of Mr. Warren is too well known to need extended eulogy. His presence will be sorely missed in many quarters where he was an important figure. He was a man of strict business habits, a firm friend, and a genial companion.</p><p>On account of the funeral of Mr. O. G, Warren, senior proprietor of the COMMERCIAL, which takes place at half-past two o’clock this afternoon, but one edition of the COMMERCIAL will be published today. It will be issued at noon and will be delivered to all subscribers.</p></blockquote><figcaption>

WARREN.</p><p>His Associates on the Press Speak of Him—A Sad Meeting of the Press Club—The Republican League Also Mourns the Loss of a Member.</p><p>The Buffalo Press Club held a meeting on Saturday to adopt resolutions of sympathy with the family of Mr. Warren.</p><p>President Kingsley spoke in very touching terms of the death of a member of the profession:</p><p>“Our dear friend,” said he, “will ever be remembered as a man who did his utmost and succeeded in the effort of making a newspaper what it ought to be. There are those here who knew him longer and more intimately than I did, who are better able to speak of him, too, so I will conclude by appointing a committee on resolutions, and for that purpose I will appoint Mr. Bennett of the Times, Mr. White of the News, and Mr. Ferris of the Courier. And while the committee is occupied we would, I am sure, like to hear expressions from those present.</p><p>George E. Matthews of the Express was the first speaker, and he said it was hard for him to speak about Mr. Warren, for they had been friends from boyhood, and in Many respects Mr. Warren had acted as his elder brother.</p><p>“Certainly,” said he, “no one could have been kinder or more helpful than he was to me. When we became men our affairs in life were separate, but I do not think that either of us ever forgot our old friendship and personally our friendship was always of the sincerest kind.</p><p>“He was essentially a very high-toned gentleman, true to his principles, and he has been so suddenly taken away from us that it is hard to recognize that fact. When he took one side of a question there never was any doubt in his mind, and his party, his friends and his paper got the most unfaltering service from him always.”</p><p>“Gentlemen,” said Edwin Fleming of the Courier, “for my own experience I May say that from the time I came to Buffalo I enjoyed the warm personal friendship of Mr. Warren. I came to know him as a straightforward, sagacious man; a man of uncommon intensity of purpose, and like all men of that kind, while full of his purpose, he was courteous, kind, and always a friend to be looked to.”</p><p>Norman E. Mack said that he could not add anything to what had been already said. O. G. Warren was a friend of his, had always been, and he mourned his loss that day.</p><p>“No man,” said he, “was more manly and more loyal to a friend than was Warren, and we have all cause to regret his sad death.”</p><p>Arthur W. Austin, city editor of the COMMERCIAL, spoke briefly, expressing the sense of personal bereavement felt by the entire staff on the death of Mr. Warren.</p><p>At this stage the committee on resolutions announced themselves and on being called on by President Kingsley, Mr. Ferris read the following resolutions:</p><p>The Buffalo Press Club had hoped to be spared for many years the record of death which this day compels.</p><p>Orsamus G. Warren&rsquo;s great activity and well balanced energies conveyed the constant assurance of many added years of usefulness and of successes further to bless his family and all with whom association could not fail to benefit.</p><p>The club speaks with gratitude of Mr. Warren’s active relations with this fraternity and in appreciation of his abiding interest and thoughtfulness for its well-being. He was proud of the newspaper as an institution and was zealous 1n advancing its standard and promoting its influence for good. His advice to those with whom he was associated was ever a counseling to better endeavor. His friendship was something to be highly prized and sacredly preserved. His qualities of mind and heart were understood only to be admired. The impress of his example will be one of enduring force upon the press of this city and state. Words are indeed inadequate to express the emotions of sorrow that we feel or the deep sympathy we have for those who were nearest to him in the holy relations of the home. We have lost a good friend and safe adviser, and his memory we shall ever revere.</p><p>It is directed that this tribute be spread upon the records of this club, and that copies hereof be sent to Mr. Warren&rsquo;s family and to the newspapers of Buffalo.</p><p>The resolutions were agreed to and the meeting concluded.</p><p>THE REPUBLICAN LEAGUE.</p><p>There was a very large attendance of the Republican League on Saturday night, and the members assembled to show their grief at the death of Mr. Warren.</p><p>President Scatcherd in calling the meeting to order said that by a close connection with Mr. Warren he had ascertained the depth of his character.</p><p>“He was to me,” said the President, “a true and honorable friend, and this club and all the members of it recognized him as an honest man and a friend.”</p><p>Arthur W. Hickman and Martin Clark also spoke of the loss sustained by the death of Mr. Warren.</p><p>“He has performed services for the Republican party,” said Judge Hatch, “which can never be forgotten. He was loyal to his friends, loyal to his party, a true friend, and one whose loss will be deeply felt in all circles of this city.”</p><p>George S. Hull, Charles K. Robinson, and Edward C. Volger, who were appointed to draft resolutions, brought in the following which were agreed to in silence:</p><p>Whereas, We of the Buffalo Republican League feel that by the sudden death of the Hon. Orsamus G. Warren, in the very prime of life, full of splendid achievement and rich promise, a man valued and trusted in the councils of the great party to which we owe allegiance, beyond any of his townsmen, the community has sustained a deep and memorable loss, and we are deprived of the advice and assistance of one of our most prominent associate members;</p><p>Resolved, That we express the feeling of appreciation for his life and work which must animate us as we recall his many services as a citizen and a statesman,to the State and Nation, but more particularly to this city, which he loved as his home. While we know that he he has so identified himself with her history that his name will be carried to future generations whenever the tale of her development is told, and that it needs no formal tribute to keep his memory green in the minds of those who live today, we would express our admiration for his genius and those rare qualities of mind and character which fitted him by nature tor the position of leadership which so long he held; and we would extend our sincere sympathy to his bereaved family and those who are more nearly called to mourn. To this end it is directed that these resolutions be spread upon the minutes of the League.</p><p>Many personal expressions of condolence were forwarded to the family from members of the club.</p><p>ACTION OF THE AMERICAN EXCHANGE BANE.</p><p>At a special meeting of the Board of Directors of the American Exchange Bank of Buffalo, held the 7th day of May, 1892, the following memorial on the death of Mr. Orsamus G. Warren, which occurred on May 6th, 1892, was unanimously adopted:</p><p>It is the painful duty of the Directors of this bank to record upon minutes the death of Orsamus G. Warren. In so doing they attest his faithfulness and zeal in the discharge of his trust, his ability, his integrity, his good judgment and wise counsel; but beyond all this they personally deplore the loss of an associate and companion, whose geniality of Nature and kindliness of spirit made his presence in-their midst seem always like sunshine, and they are filled with sorrow at the loss of a friend whose loyalty knew no bounds.</p><p>They extend to his bereaved family their sincere sympathy in their greatest sorrow.</p><pre>
In Memoriam.  
O. G. W., May 9, 1892. 
<br>
When he, the Elder Friend, was called away, 
  To thee our bond of fealty became 
A heritage of his paternal away, 
  As vital as his honored name and fame. 
<br>
Thine then became the firm and guiding hand, 
  The one appeal, the word of mastery; 
And thou dids’t come to know and understand 
  The test of an unswerving loyalty. 
<br>
Though now, alas! the twice-cemented bond, 
  Is parted by an unrelenting power, 
"Tis knit anew because our hearts respond, 
  Unto the sacred duties of the hour. 
<br>
Farewell, brave, dauntless soul! Forever more . 
  Dwell thou in realms of peace and fadeless light! 
While we who loved thee prove, as once before, 
  That Death can consecrate as well as smite! 
<br>
A.W. A.

A great mass of flowers almost buried the casket, but they came from the immediate relatives.</p><p>The body was in a parlor to the right of the entrance, and here place was made for the COMMERCIAL staff—close to all that was mortal of the man who had been very close to them in life, their wisest adviser and best friend.</p><p>The Rev.

Warren, for many years an honorary member of this Legion, a public spirited citizen, a steadfast friend of our city’s best interests, and a man stalwart in his political convictions.</p><p>Resolved, That we herewith tender our condolence to his bereaved family, and that a copy of these resolutions, properly indorsed, be forwarded to them.</p><p>The Cleveland Democracy adopted the following last evening:</p><p>Resolved, That the Cleveland Democracy joins in the general grief of our citizens at the death of O. G. Warren. Although opposed to us in politics, he was always fair, considerate, and mindful of the demands of honorable political warfare; and we therefore held him in high esteem. By his death many of us mourn a warm personal friend, and the City of Buffalo mourns the loss of an enterprising and public-spirited citizen; therefore,</p><p>Resolved, That we hereby tender to the bereaved family our deep sympathy and that these resolutions be spread upon the minutes of this organization and a copy thereof sent to the family of the deceased.</p><p>The Democratic. County Committee adopted the following resolution:</p><p>The Democratic County Committee of Erie Ceunty have learned, with feelings of deep sorrow, of the death of Orsamus G. Warren, editor of the COMMERCIAL, and long the Republican leader in this county, and deem it fit and proper that they place upon record their respect for the lamented dead.</p><p>Resolved, That in the death of Orsamus G. Warren the city of Buffalo has lost one of its most enterprising and popular citizens, and one who was ever alive to its best interests.</p><p>Resolved, That to the bereaved and stricken widow and fatherless children we tender our sincerest sympathies in this hour of sorrow and affliction.</p><p>Resolved, That these resolutions be spread upon the minutes and be published in the daily papers of this city.</p><p>The executive committee of the New York State Associated Press met yesterday at the Iroquois and appointed the following committee to draw up resolutions in memory of Mr. Warren: E. Prentiss Bailey, Carroll E. Smith, R. R. Soper, C. S. Francis, W. A. Cobb, George E. Matthews, George Bleistein, Norman E. Mack, Charles E. Austin and William B. Held. They will report at the next meeting.</p><p>The trial term of the Superior Court was adjourned yesterday by Judge Hatch, on account of the funeral of Mr. Warren.</p><p>From the Cold Spring Journal.</p><p>The writer, whose high privilege it was until the last to be associated with Mr. Warren in newspaper effort, is deeply sensible of the loss sustained of a staunch friend whose amiability and kindly counsel have often been a tower of strength to him in combatting the asperities and harass incident to the profession. But, words altogether failing in this dark hour of mourning, to convey our deep sense of sorrow at the blow which has fallen on the citizens of Buffalo, we can simply tender to the grief stricken family of Mr. Warren and our contemporary the COMMERCIAL, together with the whole of its devoted staff, our sincerest condolences at yesterday’s unhappy event, feeling, in sympathy with them all, that now the worst has happened the only real consolation in future derived will be to affectionately cherish the memory of a good and noble man whose honorable career, cut short, so untimely, shall prove an emulating power, and the truest tribute to which can be paid, is to aim ourselves at approaching the lofty level presented by his bright and enviable example.</p></blockquote><figcaption>

G. Warren Take Action Upon His Death.</p><p>A meeting of the directors of Bellevue Land and Improvement company was held at 11 o’clock this morning at the office of President Henry W. Box.</p><p>The directors present were Henry W. Box, Daniel O’Day, Joan Satterfield, John N. Scatcherd, Henry M. Watson, William Hengerer, James A. Roberts, H. H. Littell, John C. Conway and S. S. Spaulding.</p><p>George Urban, Jr., a stockholder, was also present. Charles A. Sweet, a member of the board of directors, was absent on account of sickness.</p><p>James A. Roberts offered a touching memorial upon the death of O. G. Warren, who was one of the projectors of the organization, a director, and a member of a committee intrusted with the sale of lands. Messrs. Box and Sweet were the other members of the committee. The memorial was as follows.</p><p>Since our last meeting, an honored member of this Board has died, and it seems fitting at this time that some expression of our appreciation of his work and worth should be made. To very few men have been given the somewhat opposite business qualities of fertility in resource and method in details. We can readily recall many instances of men full of suggestions and ways for promoting great business results, and who when the time comes, as it must in all enterprises, for patience, method and exactness, are worse than useless. On the other hand the world is full of men who can do nothing except follow the details of plans which others have made. Mr. Warren possessed in a highly Successful degree both of the qualities of fertility and exactness. No man with whom we have ever been associated had more abundant reliable resources at his command. His suggestions were never inapt but always practical and worthy of careful consideration. Those of us who were active in the formation of our Bellevue enterprise know the very great debt we owe Mr. Warren for his valuable suggestions. Even the name we bear came from him. In working out the details of any business he was the soul of patience, method and exactness. He was a man moreover to whom any one of us would have readily entrusted our all in the full assurance that to the uttermost farthing right would be done. As a companion he was always pleasant, lively, responsive and considerate.</p><p>Prompt, alert, resourceful, exact, honorable, agreeable, quick and clear of comprehension, he was an ideal member of any business board.</p><p>Resolved, In testimony of our high respect and appreciation of Mr. Warren and of his work for our company, this simple statement be inscribed in our minutes.</p><p>Several of those present spoke in feeling terms of Mr. Warren, expressing profound regret at his untimely death.</p><p>Then, on motion of Mr. Littell, seconded by Mr. Watson, the vacancy on the board of directors caused by Mr. Warren’s death was filled by the election of Mr. Urban.</p><p>ACTION OF THE DEPEW LAND AND IMPROVEMENT COMPANY.</p><p>At a meeting of the officers and directors of the Depew Land and Improvement Company, held this afternoon, the following resolutions on the death of Mr. Warren, were adopted:</p><p>Resolved, That in the death of Orsamus G. Warren Buffalo loses an estimable and popular citizen, one who labored unceasingly to increase its prosperity and extend its reputation, and the Depew Land and Improvement Company its Vice-President, a valued counselor and a wise director in all its affairs, and we, its officers, a loyal, generous friend, whose sudden death we feel as a personal bereavement, and we extend to the heart-stricken family our tenderest sympathy.</p><p>Resolved, That the foregoing resolution be placed upon the minutes of the company and the secretary be instructed to furnish the family with an engrossed copy.</p><p>In speaking to the resolutions Mr. Henry W. Box paid the following touching and eloquent tribute to the memory of his friend:</p><p>If I obeyed the monitions of a deeply afflicted soul I should be silent upon the resolution just offered on the death of my dear friend Warren. Such generous and loving tributes have been paid to his memory by the entire press of the state and by the varied interests with which he was associated and so important in life, that it is very difficult to speak anything new of his living actions.</p><p>Nothing is needed to keep his honor bright. One who enjoyed Mr. Warren’s friendship from early boyhood to his death, has so completely expressed my own estimate of the man, that I will read a paragraph from his editorial: “Blameless in his private life, in public he was distinguished by all the honors which a host of devoted friends and followers could induce him to accept. Successful and prosperous, with all that man desires most at his command, his sudden and untimely taking off is a calamity which comes with crushing force upon those to whom he was most near and dear.”</p><p>“In The midst of life we are in death.” Never was this saying more strikingly and sadly illustrated. Like a falling star he passes from the familiar scenes to be forevermore with the silent. Within one short week our dear friend, full of life and vigor of mind and body, in.the prime of manhood and usefulness is cut off.</p><pre>
“The glories of our birth and state 
    Are shadows, not substantial things; 
There is no armor against fate, 
    Death lays his icy hand on kings. 
<br>
“Sceptre and crown
Must tumble down, 
And in the dust be equal made 
With the poor crooked scythe and spade.” 
</pre><p>The directors of this company enjoyed an intimate personal acquaintance with Mr. Warren. We knew his manly and amiable character, and valued him for his sterling worth in his business relations.</p><p>Whatever he did was done thoroughly; always alert, enterprising and straightforward. In every relation of life Mr. Warren won and held the friendship and confidence of the men with whom he came into contact. He was always sincere, true to his convictions, and steadfast in the purposes to which his judgment committed him. Mr. Warren, at the death of his honored father, was placed in a most critical position as the director of a great newspaper property and the undisputed leader of the republican party. How well he executed the trusts confided to him we ail know.</p><p>It is not always an advantage to be the son of a distinguished father. It is common for the merits of the son to suffer injustice by comparison, but our friend was a man of uncommon intensity of purpose; his individuality was so strong that he needed no reflected light to make him a leader of men and a sagacious business man.</p><p>If our lives here are to be measured by actions, by achievements and not by figures on a dial, then the life of our friend was full. He had acquired in early manhood that which the poet considered the chief blessings of old age—wealth, honor and troops of friends.</p><p>A very close newspaper friend of Mr. Warren, speaking of his death says: “A career of eminent public and private usefulness, marked by honorable achievements has been brought to a sudden and untimely end.”</p><p>“One who was genial in all his relations with associates, staunch in his friendship and upright and true in all his dealings.</p><p>“To have done so much, to have filled spheres so important and varied and filled them so well, and before reaching his forty-sixth birthday, forms a record that will prove a blessed heritage to his family. The best of it was that a young heart and strong attachments and open ways went with it all, helped it all, were potent elements of it all, And here is the secret of friendships that bleed today.”</p></blockquote><figcaption>
