      <description>&lt;p&gt;In the Battle of Long Island, the first major battle of the American Revolution after the United States declared independence from England, the British overwhelmingly defeated the Patriots. Both Jedediah Mills (father of Mary Platt Mills) and William Mills (father of William Mills of Erie County) fought in Captain Nathaniel Platt’s Smithtown Regiment of Minute Men of Suffolk County, under the command of General Nathaniel Woodhull.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/8123/william-sidney-mount&#34;&gt;William Sidney Mount&lt;/a&gt; (26 Nov 1807 to 19 Nov 1868) was also descended from &lt;a href=&#34;https://memills.com/family-of-edward-hallock-mills/topics/genealogy/&#34;&gt;Timothy Mills of Mills Pond&lt;/a&gt;. The Long Island Museum of American Art, History, &amp;amp; Carriages owns many of William Mount&amp;rsquo;s works and the text of this section is taken from the Museum&amp;rsquo;s past exhibitions, reproduced here with permission.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Robert Mills</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The following is the research I accumulated on Robert Mills prior to determining that he was likely out-of-scope for this work. As far as I can tell, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/77507182/robert-mills&#34;&gt;Robert Mills&lt;/a&gt; (17 Nov 1824 to 11 Dec 1890) is not a descendant of Timothy Mills of Mills Pond, although he may be a descendant of John Mills &amp;ldquo;who was made freeman of Boston in 1632&amp;rdquo;. (Genealogies of Long Island Families, p105.)&lt;/p&gt;</description>
