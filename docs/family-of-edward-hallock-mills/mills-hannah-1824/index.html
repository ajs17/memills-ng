According to <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Torrans_Lathrap>Wikipedia</a>: &ldquo;Mary Torrans Lathrap née, Torrans; (pen name, Lena; April 25, 1838 - January 3, 1895), known as &ldquo;The Daniel Webster of Prohibition&rdquo;, was a 19th-century American poet, preacher, suffragist, and temperance reformer. For 20 years, she was identified with the progressive women of Michigan who had temperance, purity, and prohibition as their watchwords, and the white ribbon as their badge. A licensed preacher for the Methodist Episcopal Church (1871), she served as president of Michigan&rsquo;s Woman&rsquo;s Christian Temperance Union (1882), co-founded the state&rsquo;s suffrage organization (1870), and worked on the amendment campaign (1874). Lathrap died in 1895.&rdquo; Note the parallels to Annis Ford Eastman. This poem has been used often in obituaries since it was penned, either in part or in its entirety, and it was obviously a fitting tribute to Hannah&rsquo;s life.</li><li><a href=https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/98809451/charles-bogardus>Reverend Elder Charles Bogardus</a> (19 Nov 1843 to 12 Oct 1925).

He was well-known as Elder Bogardus.&rdquo; (12 Oct 1925, The Ithaca Journal, Ithaca NY, p5.)</li><li>Notice that in the 1870 United States Federal Census, both Hannah and then husband Charles Eastman both have checks in the columns labelled &ldquo;Cannot read.&rdquo; and &ldquo;Cannot write.&rdquo;, although presumably this is inaccurate, as Hannah is described as “a great reader”.</li></ul></div></aside></figure><figure class=quote-only><blockquote><pre>
Beautiful toiler, thy work all done,
Beautiful soul into glory gone,
Beautiful life with its crown now won,
    God giveth thee rest.
Rest from all sorrows, and watching, and fears,
Rest from all possible sighing and tears,
Rest through God's endless, wonderful years —
    At home with the blest.
<br>
Beautiful spirit, free from all stain,
Ours the heartache, the sorrow and pain,
Thine is the glory and infinite gain —
    Thy slumber is sweet.
Peace on the brow and the eyelids so calm,
Peace in the heart, ‘neath the white folded palm,
Peace dropping down like a wondrous balm
    From the head to the feet.
<br>
“It was so sudden,” our white lips said,
“How we shall miss her, the beautiful dead,
Who take the place of the precious one fled;
    But Got knoweth best.
We know He watches the sparrows that fall,
Hears the sad cry of the grieved hearts that call,
Friends, husband, children, He loveth them all —
    We can trust for the rest.”

<li>Em is a reference to Emma (English) Wheeler (1875-1968), wife of Clarence Wheeler (1876-1951). George writes of both often.</li>
<li>On 24 Mar 1917, George noted &ldquo;New Proprietor meat market opens to day&rdquo;. According to Gertrude Conant in her contribution to <em>A Drive-by Tour of the Town of Caroline</em> (Tour 4-P8), the meat market was across the street from Mills&rsquo; home at present day 470 Brooktondale Road, the Todi&rsquo;s home: &ldquo;&lsquo;Calf&rsquo; Charlie Vandemark had a meat market here, next to his house. It was later owned by Clarence Wheeler who also had a meat cart and went around the town selling door to door.&rdquo; A photo that presumably shows Clarence standing next to a horse-drawn wagon bearing his name can be found on the bottom of page 86 of <em>Around Caroline</em> by Patricia A. Brhel.</li>

<li><a href=https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/96968839/julia-e-reed>Julia E. Reed</a> (1846 to 25 Aug 1916). &ldquo;Miss Julia Reed, who has ben [sic] ill for several weeks of heart trouble, died at her home in Brookon Friday evening, August 25. Miss Reed lived the greater part of her life in this neighborhood and is a member of the Central Chapel Church. Because of her kindly and charitable disposition she leaves an unusually large circle of friends who will miss her greatly.&rdquo; (01 Sep 1916, The Ithaca Journal, Ithaca NY, p7.) &quot; The funeral of Miss Julia E. Reed was very largely attended from the home of Mr. and Mrs. Melvin Lynch Monday at 2 p.m. &hellip; Mrs. Sarah Leonard spent last week at Melvin Lynch&rsquo;s helping to care for her sister Miss Julia Reed.&quot; (30 Aug 1916, The Ithaca Journal, Ithaca NY, p7.)</li>
<li>Ann J. Irey (? to 28 May 1917). &ldquo;Mrs. J. B. Irey suffered a very severe shock of paralysis and is now in a critical condition.&rdquo; (13 Feb 1917, The Ithaca Journal, Ithaca NY, p7.) George Jansen, in his 1917 journal, gives regular accounts of Mrs. Irey&rsquo;s condition in her final weeks (she &ldquo;has got a shock&rdquo; as he put it), including her last night. 07 Apr 1917 is typical: &ldquo;Mrs. Irey howled all night&rdquo;. And her final day, 28 May 1917: &ldquo;I sat up all night with Mrs. Irey so Emeline could have a little rest. I expect her to breathe her last any minute. Respiration 30 a minute 2AM. Mrs. Irey died 1:30 PM today.&rdquo; The next day, 29 May 1917: &ldquo;Digging Mrs. Irey grave today.&rdquo; 30 May 1917: &ldquo;Mrs. Irey funeral today.&rdquo;</li>

<p><a href=https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/168944385/hannah-mills>Hannah</a> is interred at Pleasant Grove Cemetery, 184 Pleasant Grove Rd, Ithaca NY 14850, in the Thatcher family plot, and is listed on the same marker as her parents, her sister, and her sister&rsquo;s husband:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href=https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/239203286/thomas-thatcher>Thomas Thatcher</a> (03 Jul 1785 to 17 Jun 1863), Hannah&rsquo;s father.</p>
</li>

<p><a href=https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/239203315/elizabeth-thatcher>Elizabeth (Crosby) Thatcher</a> (12 Feb 1790 to 29 Mar 1873), Hannah&rsquo;s mother.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href=https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/166934176/william-vanderveere>William P. Vanderveere</a> (04 Sep 1831 to 27 May 1882), Hannah&rsquo;s brother-in-law.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href=https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/166933990/elizabeth-vanderveere>Elizabeth Vanderveere</a> (1829 to 1888), Hannah&rsquo;s sister.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>As with Emily, the birth year on Hannah&rsquo;s grave is incorrect based on two independent sources: the 1900 United States Federal census that indicates Hannah was born &ldquo;May 1824&rdquo; in England:</p>
<figure class=image style=max-width:800px><img src=/family-of-edward-hallock-mills/assets/images/census/census-1900-us-inset_hu64f80c9bf7cb678c7395c0a99f9821c7_185220_800x0_resize_q75_box.jpg width=800 height=88 alt><figcaption>

<p>The exact date is reported in The Ithaca Journal, 23 May 1916, p9: &ldquo;Mrs. Hannah Mills spent her ninety-second birthday Sunday, May 21.&rdquo; Although admittedly, the wording of this does leave some room for imprecision with regard to the exact day, it at least corroborates the month and year from the 1900 census. Yet her stone lists her birth year as 1825.</p>
<p>As I write this in Spring 2022, the Thatcher stone is badly weathered and difficult to read, and the footstones are in even worse condition. The plot is in the front of the cemetery, the middle section, a few rows back from the road. The Thatcher name, and the side of the stone with Hannah&rsquo;s parents names, faces toward the back of the cemetery, Hannah&rsquo;s side faces toward Community Corners in Cayuga Heights, the Vanderveere&rsquo;s side faces toward Cornell. In other words, the front of the stone is facing the back of the cemetery, the opposite of what one would expect, and inconsistent with all other stones I saw, suggesting the stone was rotated at one point.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s likely the main stone has been moved somewhat, and the footstones realigned with it. According to the Pleasant Grove Cemetery records shown below, William Vanderveere&rsquo;s stone is the one that appears to missing.</p>

<p>The 2016 photos show the &ldquo;MOTHER&rdquo; footstone leaning against the main family stone, confirming that the stones have been moved in the past. In fact, because these photos are close-up, the direction of the camera and therefore, the orientation of the main stone, is not clear, and the main stone itself may have been turned. (As I write this, the main stone faces the rear of the cemetery, away from the road.)</p>

<li>
<p><a href=https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/122023540/edward-c-thatcher>Edward C. Thatcher</a> (1863 to 04 Jun 1937). Married <a href=https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/122023541/blanche-m-thatcher>Blanche M. Thatcher</a> (1886 to 24 Sep 1968)</p>
</li>

<p><a href=https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/86690565/minnie-a-smith>Minnie A. (Thatcher) Smith</a> (1867 to 23 Jun 1936). Married <a href=https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/86690515/william-smith>Dr. William A. Smith</a> (01 Feb 186? to 31 Mar 1934), former Tompkins County Coroner. Minnie&rsquo;s obituary notes: &ldquo;she is survived by two daughters, Mrs. Agnes Shulman of Ithaca and Mrs. Alleine Estabrook of Newfield&hellip;&rdquo;.</p>

</ul>
<p>Currently unknown:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href=https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/188088574/myron-n-tompkins>Myron N. Tompkins</a> (1859 to 21 Mar 1911) former Dean of the Tompkins county bar. I do not currently know the relationship between Myron and the other Tompkins&rsquo;, if any, but he is the person Hannah named as her executor.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Edgar Thatcher. I initially thought this was a mistaken reference to Edward Thatcher, and that is still a possibility, but I have seen this name referenced in a few places, so perhaps not. I have been unable to identify this person.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Silas Thatcher, a &ldquo;farm laborer&rdquo; listed in the 1850 federal census living with the Thatcher family, and in the 1860 federal census was living with a family by the name Fleming. He also indicates England is his origin, and given his age, he is likely Thomas Thatcher&rsquo;s brother. (A possible daughter: <a href="https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/79475027/sarah-c-o'brien">Sarah C. (Thatcher) O&rsquo;Brien</a>.)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Both the Thatchers and the Tompkins families are associated with the towns of Newfield and Catharine, with Edward living in Cayutaville, and a few descendants living in Ithaca.</p>
<p>Hannah&rsquo;s immigration information is based on naturalization documents of her brother David Thatcher from 1839, that are on still on file with the Tompkins County Clerk&rsquo;s Office. I conclude this document identifies Hannah Mills&rsquo; brother based on the document matching several known data points: first and last name, town of residence, age, country of origin, and the voyage happened within the expected timeframe. As a result, I am also using this document as the source for David&rsquo;s exact birthdate, as prior to seeing this, I only knew the year.</p>

<p>Elizabeth Vanderveere appears to be Hannah&rsquo;s sister, based on the following data points:</p>
<ul>
<li>The 16 Oct 1850 United States Federal census shows the Thatcher family in Newfield with a 21 year old woman named Elizabeth. The age and birthplace are consistent with this being the Thomas and Elizabeth&rsquo;s daughter, and matches the age of Elizabeth Vanderveere.</li>
<li>The 01 Jun 1865 New York State Census shows Hannah and Charles Eastman living with 36 year old Elizabeth Thatcher, identified as &ldquo;sister in law&rdquo; and 75 year old Elizabeth Thatcher identified as &ldquo;mother in law&rdquo;.</li>
<li>The 04 Aug 1870 United States Federal census shows William and Elizabeth Vanderveere living with the widowed Elizabeth (Crosby) Thatcher. Both Elizabeth Thatcher and Elizabeth Vanderveere list England as their birthplace.</li>
<li>And obviously, the Vanderveere&rsquo;s are buried in the Thatcher family plot.</li>

<li>According to <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bright%27s_disease>Wikipedia</a>: “Bright&rsquo;s disease is a historical classification of kidney diseases that are described in modern medicine as acute or chronic nephritis. It was characterized by swelling and the presence of albumin in the urine, and was frequently accompanied by high blood pressure and heart disease. …It is now known that Bright&rsquo;s disease is caused by a wide and diverse range of kidney diseases; thus, the term Bright&rsquo;s disease is retained strictly for historical application. The disease was diagnosed frequently in diabetic patients; at least some of these cases would probably correspond to a modern diagnosis of diabetic nephropathy.”</li>

<p><strong>First Took Office Jan. 1, 1916—Was Health Officer of Town of Newfield for 25 Years—Health Began to Fail About 8 Years Ago</strong></p>
<p>Dr. William A. Smith, 67, coroner of Tompkins County since Jan. 1, 1916, and for many years before that health officer of the Town of Newfield, died at his home, 308 Lake Avenue at 10 o’clock Saturday night, Mar. 31, following a [l]ong illness.</p>
<p>Doctor Smith was born at Catherine[sic] Schuyler County, on Feb. 1, 186[?] and graduated from the Dundee High School. He studied medicine for two years at the University of Michigan and later attended the Long Island Hospital College from which he graduated in 1889.</p>
<p>After graduation, Doctor Smith began practice at Geneva. Six years later he moved to Newfield where he practiced for 35 years. During 25 years of that time he served as health officer.</p>
<p>Doctor Smith became a Republican candidate for the office of county coroner in the fall of 1915 and was elected over Dr. A. A. Chase. His term was for three years and he was re-elected at every election since, on several occasions having the Democratic endorsement as well as the Republican. He was re-elected last year over Dr. M. J. Foran.</p>
<p><strong>Underwent Operation</strong></p>
<p>Eight years ago Doctor Smith’s health began to fail and he went to New York where he underwent a major operation. The operation was successful and he had been in good health until about a year ago when he removed to Ithaca.</p>
<p>Besides his widow, Doctor Smith is survived by two daughters, Mrs. Agnes Shulman of Ithaca and Mrs. Alliene Esterbrook of Newfield; seven grandchildren of Newfield; his mother, Mrs. Olive A. Smith of Odessa and one sister, Mrs. Clarence Hausner of Odessa.</p>
<p>Private funeral services will be held at the family home, 308 Lake Avenue, at 2 o’clock Wednesday afternoon, Apr. 4. The Rev. Henry P. Horton, rector of St. John’s Episcopal Church, will officiate. Interment will be in Laurel Cemetery at Odessa.</p>
<p>Doctor Smith was a past master of King Hiram, Lodge, F. and A. Masons of Newfield.</p>

<p>I have contacted several living descendants of David Thatcher, and Joan Taber of Newfield appears to be the one with the greatest knowledge of the family history, having preserved many artifacts and performed her own research over the years. At one time, she thought she may have had a photo of David Thatcher, and she also believes she has some Eastman materials. According to Joan and another descendant, there are family anecdotes about Thomas Thatcher ringing the church bells in England, and there are references in their documents to a &ldquo;Mercy Thatcher&rdquo; although nobody seems to know who this person might be exactly.</p>
<h2 id=the-eastmans>The Eastmans</h2>
<p>Charles Eastman had a daughter <a href=https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/80753410/hannah-meaker>Hannah (Eastman) Meaker</a> (15 May 1843 to 20 Dec 1881), who appears to be Cyrus&rsquo; twin sister and wife of George M. Meaker. George M. Meaker&rsquo;s parents are <a href=https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/80752505/reuben-e-meaker>Reuben E. Meaker</a> (1823 to 09 Jun 1894) and <a href=https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/80752649/elsie-meaker>Elsie (Briggs) Meaker</a> (1824 to 09 Mar 1893). Hannah and George&rsquo;s children include two daughters, <a href=https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/187482089/mame-crance>Mamie Elsie (Meaker) Crance</a> (15 Jan 1873 to 13 Oct 1955) and <a href=https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/231453734/ida-adelia-husted>Ida Adelia (Meaker) Husted</a> (21 Jul 1878 to 08 Jul 1958)</p>
<p>There is another Hannah Eastman in Caroline at this time: <a href=https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/91574581/hannah-v-eastman>Hannah V. (Smith) Eastman</a> (1826 to 05 Feb 1892) who was married to <a href=https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/91575045/reuben-b-eastman>Reuben B. Eastman</a> (Jun 1829 to 15 Nov 1913), Charles C. Eastman&rsquo;s brother.</p>
<p>Charles C. Eastman had a son <a href=https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/116398712/charles-henry-eastman>Charles Henry Eastman</a>, so references to &ldquo;Mrs. Charles Eastman&rdquo; may also need to be disambiguated. As evidenced by the deeds below, Charles Henry Eastman&rsquo;s family moved from Danby to Michigan by 1891.</p>
<p>All that in mind, I believe all of the deeds that follow are referencing Hannah Mills:</p>

<p>I have contacted one descendant of Charles C. and Polly Eastman, Jodi Leaf, and she is the most knowledgable Eastman family historian, having done much of her own research, and contributing genealogies, photos, etc. to findagrave.com and ancestry.com. Numerous family photos exist starting with the children of Charles C. and Polly Eastman.</p>
