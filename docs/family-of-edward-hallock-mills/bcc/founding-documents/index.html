The minister for twenty-five years was Rev. Garrett Mandeville. Persuaded by his wife&rsquo;s cousin, Simeon DeWitt, to visit Ithaca, he came from Ulster County and served in Ithaca and Trumansburg until 1812, when he bought a farm in Caroline. A post office for Boiceville, opened in 1823, was named Slaterville after Levi Slater, the first town clerk. The village developed to the east with a Methodist church, stores, mills, and taverns to serve the farmers and turnpike traffic.</p></blockquote><figcaption><cite><p>— Molly Adams, &ldquo;Town of Caroline&rdquo; in <em>The Towns of Tompkins County: From Podunk to the Magnetic Springs</em> edited by Jane Marsh Dieckmann, p52-53.</p></cite></figcaption></figure><figure><blockquote>In 1868 the CONGREGATIONAL CHURCH was formed at Brooktondale by members of the BROOKTON METHODIST and the REFORMED CHURCH OF AMERICA. A foundation had been created for a Methodist Church, but when the new organization was formed, the Varna Presbyterian Church building was purchased and moved to the Methodist Foundation. The building is in active use by the CAROLINE VALLEY FEDERATED CHURCH. The steeple was blown down during a wind storm in 1925. A fiberglass steeple was lifted to its platform by a crane from H. D. Besemer Co. on 22 June 1977. The bell was bought from the Dutch Reformed Church by the Congregationalists, and is probably the oldest bell in this area.</blockquote><figcaption><cite>— 1994, <em>A History of the Town of Caroline Tompkins County, New York United States of America</em>, revised and compiled by Barbara B.

WM. S. HILLS</p><p>Rev Wm. S. Hills, pastor of the Congregational church of this city, crossed the River Friday, October 26, at 5:45 a.m. after a long and painful sickness that has elicited the warm sympathy of the whole community towards him and his family. Mr. Hills was born of English parentage on North River, near Tarrytown, New York, May 16, 1834, and thus was nearly midway between 72 and 73 years of age at the time of his death. His parents were emmigrants from Yarmouth, England and he was reared under the care of a good foster mother, who instilled into his mind in his earliest years the elements of the Christian religion.</p><p>Mr. Hills&rsquo; education for his life work was gained through the common schools of New York, and through the handcrafts of wagon making, baker, and mechanic, a start in life of no mean sort coming to so earnest a soul. In 1854 Mr. Hills married Mrs. Julia Sackett, whom he now leaves a widow of 52 years of wedded life at an age equal to his own. Three children were born of this union, of whom one only, Laura Amelia, together with an adopted grandson, William Walter, survive the death of their father.</p><p>When the war broke out Mr. Hills resided in New York. He answered the call of his country by active service in the South with the Engineer Corps as a bridge-builder, but, somehow or other and unfortunately, without being formally enlisted as a soldier. This fact debarred him from the advantages that come with the wearing of the G. A. R. Button, not the least of which was the eligibility to pension and the right to a soldiers&rsquo; claim of Government land.</p><p>Mr. Hills was reared in an Episcopalian atmosphere, but while still a youth turned to the non-ritualistic religion and worship of the Congregational church. He felt the call to preach and began work as a lay preacher. It was his good fortune to be thrown into the company of the famous Beecher family various members of which took a lively interest in the growing layman and shaped his course in life by superintending the lay-preacher&rsquo;s studies. At different times Mr. Hills recited his studies in Theology and homiletics to James, T. K., Henry Ward or Harriet Beacher. When Mr. Hills was ordained in 1866 at Wellburg, N. Y. into the regular Congregational ministry, it was largely the outcome of the inspiration of the direction of this gifted family.</p><p>The career of Rev. W. S. has been characteristic of frontier times. Very surely upon him has fallen the heat and burden of the day. Could the whole story of Mr. Hills&rsquo; ministry be told it would rank with the classics of frontier ministry. This partial list of places covered by Mr. Hills&rsquo; ministry tells a story of strenuous life, of hardships endured as a good soldier of Jesus Christ. Mr. Hills served Congregational churches at Pottersville, Penn., Perry and Bevier, Mo., York Town, Neb., where he and a Methodist circuit rider had the work of four counties divided between them; Hamilton, Verdon, Eagle, Wymore and Alma, Neb.; Garfield, Nickerson, Ochletree, Linwood and Longton, Kansas. Besides these scattered points Mr. Hills had appointments in Texas, and in the Territory and Oklahoma.</p><p>In all this frontier work Mr. Hills was serving under the commission of the Home Missionary Society, and at a salary that never really reached the dignity of a living wage. Had Mr. Hills followed his trade he would doubtless long ago laid up a competency, for he was active, energetic and of the temperament that leads to success in business. But he literally devoted himself to the preaching of the Gospel and sad to relate, as a consequence his widow and daughter are left in destitute circumstances, so far as this worlds goods are concerned. Both are in delicate health and will need the financial assistance of the benevolent. There ought to be some system by which the churches that have thriven on Mr. Hills&rsquo; life blood in past years might have an opportunity to take care of his family now that he is gone.</p><p>Though serving small frontier churches through a long life time Mr. Hills was a forceful and efficient preacher. His pulpit work showed the earmarks of the Beechers, who were his teachers and he was worthy of much wider hearing that circumstances accorded him. The citizens of Longton, without regard to church affiliations, acting generously upon broad humanitarian principles have nobly done their part in the work of relief, and will still do more. The Congregational churches of the state will help the widow and daughter of the deceased.</p><p>Rev.

From Molly Adams&rsquo; research notes in the Caroline History Room: &ldquo;Walker Personius was a Civil War veteran and the village postmaster in 1882. He seems to have been the owner of Mott&rsquo;s original store which he called Personius Hall. The building had a large meeting space on the second floor, with seats that folded down from the wall. Memorial Day (then called Decoration Day) processions always formed in front of that building (see photo) and perhaps the David Ireland Post of Civil War Veterans met in that building. It seems clear that the post office was still at 559 Brooktondale Road in 1882.&rdquo; I don&rsquo;t know what photo was being referenced in the preceding passage. From &ldquo;Tour 3 - P8&rdquo; in A Drive-by Tour of the Town of Caroline: &ldquo;1st Post Office & store, left &ndash; 559 Brooktondale Road. We think this building was built by Mr. Mott, who owned most of the land at that time. &mldr;The G.A.R. lined up here to march to the [Quick, presently Brookton] cemetery to put flowers on the graves. There was a tannery between this house and the next before 1853 owned by Silsbury & [Edward] Lounsbery.&rdquo; Walker Personius and Edward Lounsbery were also charter members of the Congregational Church of Mott&rsquo;s Corners, presently called Caroline Valley Community Church, and were instrumental in its formation. George Richardson, who appears to have worked for Edward Mills at a time when Edward was Postmaster, eventually started his own grocery business in &ldquo;the old Personius store&rdquo; starting May 1897.</li><li>The service descriptions that follow are all taken from the unit rosters of the respective regiments found on the New York State Military Museum and Veterans Research Center website, accessed Summer 2022.</li><li>(Likely) <a href=https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/31030925/j-w-finn>J.

Memorial Day (then called Decoration Day) processions always formed in front of that building (see photo) and perhaps the David Ireland Post of Civil War Veterans met in that building.

A binding layer of stone dust (crushed stone from the original material) may form; it may also, after rolling, be covered with a cement or bituminous binder to keep dust and stones together. The method simplified what had been considered state-of-the-art at that point. &mldr;McAdam&rsquo;s renown is his effective and economical construction, which was a great improvement over the methods used by his generation. He emphasized that roads could be constructed for any kind of traffic, and he helped to alleviate the resentment travelers felt toward increasing traffic on the roads. His legacy lies in his advocacy of effective road maintenance and management. He advocated a central road authority with trained professional officials who could be paid a salary that would keep them from corruption.

The other most commonly used title is F. & A.M., or Free and Accepted Masons. &mldr; The ancient craftsmen were very skilled, and their craft was considered to be indispensable to the welfare of both church and state. For this reason, they were not placed under the same restrictions of other workers - they were &ldquo;free&rdquo; to do their work, travel and live their lives in a manner which befitted their importance. In Medieval England, this freedom of movement was almost unheard. Most workers were under bond to the owners of the land on which they worked. We believe this freedom for the operative mason may date back as far as the year 946 in York. The word &ldquo;accepted&rdquo; also goes back to the time of the operative mason. During the latter years of the Middle ages, there were few educated men outside the monasteries of the church. Naturally, men wanted to become Freemasons to get the advantages the Craft had to offer. These men did not necessarily want to build buildings, they wanted to belong to the organization. These were &ldquo;accepted&rdquo; Masons rather than operative masons. This practice probably originated when some of the people for whom craftsmen were working asked to be admitted and the practice grew with time. This was a big boost to Masonry, because the secret techniques of building trades were becoming more widely known, the requirements of architecture were changing, and our operative membership was declining. By becoming &ldquo;speculative,&rdquo; we grew rapidly. As time went on, there became more and more of the accepted members than there were operative members. Sometime in the late seventeenth century, we believe the accepted masons outnumbered the operative masons, and we became a speculative organization rather than operative one. The reason for this difference is that in England when Grand Lodges first started, there was a rivalry between two factions of Masons. One faction adopted the title &ldquo;Ancient&rdquo; and the other did not. This carried over to the United States where both titles are still in existence.&rdquo; (<a href=http://www.mastermason.com/wilmettepark/intro.html>mastermason.com</a>.)</li></ul></div></aside></figure><p>In the 1866 Stone & Stewart Atlas shown above, S.

Passing Away 
Poet: Unknown
<br>
<p>The fragrance of the rose,
Whose dewy leaves in morning&rsquo;s light unclose,
Goes not more sweetly up
From its rich heart, as from an incense cup,
Than thy freed spirit from its earthly shrine
Passed with the still angel to the rest divine.</p>
<p>Oh no! Thou didst not die!
Thou hast but lain the soul&rsquo;s frail vesture by,
And soared to that pure height
Where day serene is followed by no night,
And where the discipline of mortal woe
No shadow over thee can ever throw.</p>
<p>Death never comes to such
With chillness in the mystery of his touch:
They gently pass away
As melts the morning star in golden day;
They leave the places they have known below,
And through the white gates of the morning go.</p>
<p>We would not call thee back
To the frail flowers that wither on our track,
Perhaps to have thy feet
Pierced by the thorns that we so often meet:
For thou art in that fairer world than ours
Where love mourns not the fading of the flowers.</p>
<p>Why should we weep for thee
When thy pure soul from every ill is free?
Our only tears should flow
For those, the loved, who linger still below,
From whom the light of thy dear smile is fled,
Who feel indeed that thou art with the dead.</p>
<p>We know the gloomy grave
Holds not the spirit which our Father gave;
That loving, lustrous light,
That made the sphere in which it moved so bright,
Is shining with a clear and quenchless flame.
Rekindled at the source from whence it came.</p>
<p>Thou art not dead! For death
Can only take away the mortal breath;
And life, commencing here.
Is but the prelude to its full career;
And Hope and Faith the blest assurance give -
