<p>Interestingly, each photo is not only a different size, but shows at least one edge that the other does not, suggesting that neither photograph is a first generation print.</p>

<p>I haven&rsquo;t yet been able to examine the physical artifact in the Gertrude Conant Collection, but after consulting with the authors of the 150th Anniversary Handbook, I learned that the photo was scanned from an 11x14 print photograph in the possession of the Lounsbery family and that the photograph was large enough that it could not be scanned whole in a single pass, thus the Handbook photo shows a cropped version of the source photograph. A patient member of the Lounsbery family did provide me with digital photographs of the source photograph that show all edges.</p>

<p>The Lounsbery print still lacks the content on the left edge of the Conant version, cutting Sarah Wall in half, but it otherwise shows more content on every other edge than the Conant version, and reveals that Alonzo Gorsline is holding his hat in his left hand. It also appears to show the top edge of the entryway at the top of the stairs.</p>
<p>Each photo has accompanying identifying information.</p>

<p>Each set of identities corroborates and expands upon the other, while there are also interesting conflicts. Most obvious is the fact that &ldquo;Mrs. Dr. Lockwood&rdquo; <em>is</em> Mittie Lockwood. And of course, even the corroborated identities are not guaranteed to be correct. So, though the probability of Emily Mills being in this photo is very small, it is still non-zero.</p>
<p>The Lounsbery photograph that was scanned for the Church Handbook had the identifications written on the reverse side.</p>

### 1 and 3: Paul Landon/Elihu Personeus

I have listed these two entries together because of some ambiguity in the Conant version labels. Whereas the label "On Ladder: ?" in the Lounsbery/Handbook version clearly is referring to what I have numbered 1, as in that version, the boy numbered 3 is identified as a "(?boy)" (and from the photographs of the back of the print, neither appear to be identified), in the Conant version, this is open to interpretation. I have not yet identified Elihu Personeus (also searching for variations of both names, such as Eliju, Elijah and Person**i**us spelled with an "i", Elihu as a middle name, etc.) and the only Paul Landon I can find is Cassie Landon's son [Paul Samuel Landon](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/116492612/paul-samuel-landon) (28 Jul 1900 to 08 May 1981). Cassie Landon is also purportedly present in the photo (corroborated by both versions) and although the mustachioed gentleman in the hat appears to be seated on the only clearly visible ladder, the boy is presumably standing on *something* we cannot see, and perhaps the person who supplied the labels for the Conant version knows context of the event that we don't. 

But until I can positively identify the name Elihu Personeus, which would presumably clear this up, I am continuing with the most straightforward interpretation, that both references to the ladder indicate the only ladder clearly visible.

### 2: **VERIFIED** Jessie Brewer

[Jessie M. (Shurter) Brewer](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/99536961/jessie-m-brewer) (27 Jun 1881 to 16 Sep 1974). Jessie Brewer is still remembered by many older residents, and I know of a number of photographs in which she is identified.

<p>Jesse Brewer ran a dry goods store in Brooktondale, selling fabric, ribbon, greeting cards, and other items. She took it over from a woman who had managed a grocery store in the same building and used the proceeds from the store to increase the family income and help support her widowed [step-]mother. She was also active in the Caroline Valley Federated (now Community) Church.</p>

Jessie Brewer joined the church rolls when she and Emily Mills were [baptized](https://memills.com/family-of-edward-hallock-mills/topics/baptism/) by Reverend Annis Ford Eastman 07 Apr 1907. Jessie was active for many years in the Women's Christian Temperance Union and the Congregational Ladies' Aid Society. 


### 4: Laura Baker	

[Laura (Dorn) Baker](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/80922032/laura-baker) (1860-1933). 

### 5: Mrs. Spaulding	

### 6: Lide Vorhis

### 7: Cassie Landon
		
[Catharine F. "Cassie" (Woodhull) Landon](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/67294683/catharine-f-landon) (Apr 1870 to 08 Nov 1944) was a very active member of the church who at different times served as pianist/organist, and also taught and helped organize the Sunday School. The Ithaca Daily Journal on 15 Jan 1909 notes that Cassie was elected treasurer of the Congregational Sunday School. A 1913 entry in *Congregational Church 1868-1933 Minutes of Meetings and Membership* lists "Mrs. Cassie Landon & Paul".

Cassie is the daughter of [Samuel Smith Woodhull](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/153809194/samuel-smith-woodhull) (Apr 1842 to 27 Dec 1917) who was a Civil War veteran, member of the David Ireland Post, G.A.R and was believed to have been the last surviving member of his Company under the command of General Sheridan. 23 Feb 1917, Sam repaired the porch columns on Mills’ store.


### 8:Anna Mulks

[Anna M. Mulks](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/67295299/anna-m-mulks) (1869-1949). 

### 9: George Peck

[George Riley Peck](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/20462930/george-riley-peck) (14 May 1851 to 28 Nov 1916).

<li>From <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carpet_beater">Wikipedia.org</a> &ldquo;A carpet beater or carpetbeater (also referred to as a rug beater, carpet whip, rug whip, clothes-beater, dust beater, carpet duster, wicker slapper, rug duster, or pillow fluffer, and formerly also as a carpet cleaner or rug cleaner) is a housecleaning tool used to beat carpets in order to shake dust and dirt out of them. Originally designed by Melville R. Bissell in 1876, it was in common use until the vacuum cleaner became widely affordable. Typically made of wood, rattan, cane, wicker, spring steel or coiled wire, antique rug beaters have become very collectible. Modern mass-production versions can also be in plastic or wire. Carpets, rugs, clothes, cushions, and bedding were hung over a clothesline, railing, or a special carpet hanger, and the dust and dirt was beaten out of them. Some people preferred to beat carpets in winter on the snow - they laid the carpet face down and beat it. This method had some advantages - for instance, insects would freeze to death even if they were not expelled through beating - but it left a dirty and unpleasant-looking patch on the snow, and therefore some communities forbade beating on the snow for aesthetic reasons. Another way is to spread some snow over the carpet. In this way the dust is caught but the snow does not go up in the air. Its use in cleaning has been largely replaced since the 1950s by the carpet sweeper and then the vacuum cleaner, although they are still sold in many household stores throughout Europe. A carpet beater may also be used to beat the dust out of sofas, futons, etc. In this case the beaten furniture is covered by a wet rag to collect dust.&rdquo;</li>

<p>Because homes used to be lit with whale oil or kerosene and heated with wood or coal, the winter months left a layer of soot and grime in every room. With the arrival of spring, women would throw open windows and doors, and take rugs and bedding outside and beat dust out of them and start scrubbing floors and windows until sparkling.
</p>
<p>"In most climates, you can't clean very effectively in the middle of the winter," says Barbara Clark Smith, curator at the Smithsonian's National Museum of American History. "Warmer weather made it possible to get the house really clean."
</p>
<p>In many homes, men would get turned out of the house while women completed the week-long spring chores. "The house would literally be emptied out," says Susan Strasser, history professor at University of Delaware, who wrote the book "Never Done: A History of American Housework."

<blockquote>
In North America and northern Europe, the custom found an especially practical value due to those regions' continental and wet climates. During the 19th century in America, prior to the advent of the vacuum cleaner, March was often the best time for dusting because it was getting warm enough to open windows and doors (but not warm enough for insects to be a problem), and the high winds could carry the dust out of the house. This time of year is also when coal furnaces wouldn't run and one could wash the soot from the walls and furniture left by the furnace. For the same reason, modern rural households often use the month of March for cleaning projects involving the use of chemical products which generate fumes.
