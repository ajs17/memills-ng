<p>James Wheelock Mills (1856?, Staten Island NY to between 31 July 1857 and 19 Jun 1860, Staten Island NY). The only evidence I have found for the existence of James Wheelock Mills is his baptism record in the Reformed Dutch Church of Port Richmond, Staten Island NY.</p><figure class=image style=max-width:800px><img src=/family-of-edward-hallock-mills/assets/images/staten-island/RDC/rdc-scan_073_hu0e9a3253c33fd92654758854d01aae0c_1864656_800x0_resize_box_3.png width=800 height=867 alt><blockquote><table>

As yet, I have not found the Mills family in the 1850 United States Federal Census or the 1855 New York State Census, but I suspect that he was born after the 1855 census.</p><figure class=image style=max-width:800px><img src=/family-of-edward-hallock-mills/assets/images/census/census-1860-us_hu155c8978054a6b52a2c12e8b664fe244_2803536_800x0_resize_q75_box.jpg width=800 height=378 alt><figcaption>

So, I believe that James died under five years old.</p><p>This would mean that the Mills left Staten Island within a few years of James&rsquo; death, just as they left Corfu a few years after Horace&rsquo;s. If my speculation holds, even if James died at the latest possible time, Emily would likely have not had memories of him.</p><p>I cannot find any other records for James in <em>The Records of the Reformed Protestant Dutch Church on Staten Island</em>, including many pages of gravestone transcriptions, with the exception of the single baptism record shown above. I cannot find James on FindAGrave or Ancestry.</p><p>I have reached out to both the Reformed Dutch Church and Moravian Cemetery (where I believe he is most likely to be buried) to get more information on James, especially birth and death dates, confirmation on where he is buried and a possible cause of death.</p><p>Finally, the data above is taken from transcribed records of the Reformed Dutch Church. Therefore, I cannot rule out the possibility that &ldquo;Wheelock&rdquo; was mis-transcription from &ldquo;Hallock&rdquo;.</p></div></article></main><aside>
