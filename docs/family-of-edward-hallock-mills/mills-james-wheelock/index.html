<p>James Wheelock Mills (1856?, Staten Island NY to between 31 July 1857 and 19 Jun 1860, Staten Island NY). The only evidence I have found for the existence of James Wheelock Mills is his baptism record in the Reformed Dutch Church of Port Richmond, Staten Island NY.</p><figure class=image style=max-width:800px><img src=/family-of-edward-hallock-mills/assets/images/staten-island/RDC/rdc-scan_073_hu0e9a3253c33fd92654758854d01aae0c_1864656_800x0_resize_box_3.png width=800 height=867 alt><blockquote><table>

(Horace&rsquo;s middle name Franklin is rare, but not unique, in the Mills genealogy.) This is apparently a surname, likely of someone from either Staten Island or Hempstead, but as yet, I cannot link someone with this name to the Mills.</p><p>Note several bounding dates for James&rsquo; birth and death: he was presumably born sometime after Edward and Mary Ann married on 29 Dec 1850, and presumably died between the date of his baptism, 31 Jul 1857 , and before the United States Federal Census recorded on 19 Jun 1860 which includes the entire Mills family except James. As yet, I have not found the Mills family in the 1850 United States Federal Census or the 1855 New York State Census, but I suspect that he was born after the 1855 census.</p><figure class=image style=max-width:800px><img src=/family-of-edward-hallock-mills/assets/images/census/census-1860-us_hu155c8978054a6b52a2c12e8b664fe244_2803536_800x0_resize_q75_box.jpg width=800 height=378 alt><figcaption>

So, I believe that James died under five years old.</p><p>This would mean that the Mills left Staten Island within a few years of James&rsquo; death, just as they left Corfu a few years after Horace&rsquo;s. If my speculation holds, even if James died at the latest possible time, Emily would likely have not had memories of him.</p><p>I cannot find any other records for James in <em>The Records of the Reformed Protestant Dutch Church on Staten Island</em>, including many pages of gravestone transcriptions, with the exception of the single baptism record shown above. Kathleen Langdon from the Reformed Dutch Church performed an independent search and also could not find him. Finally, I have also examined the First of Staten Island/Stapleton records on Ancestry.com, and I did not find the Mills there.</p><p>I have not found James in any records on FindAGrave, FamilySearch, or Ancestry.</p><p>Decades after the Mills left Staten Island, members of Charles Pine&rsquo;s family were buried in Moravian Cemetery in New Dorp.</p><figure>
<blockquote>
<p>
Moravian Cemetery, located at 2205 Richmond Road, opened in 1740 and is the largest and oldest active cemetery on Staten Island.
</p><p>
In what was a purely farming community, the 113-acre (46 ha) cemetery was originally made available as a free cemetery for the public in order to discourage families from using farm burial plots. The Moravian Cemetery is the burial place for a number of famous Staten Islanders, including members of the Vanderbilt family.

</figcaption></figure><p>The Vanderbilt family were members of the Reformed Dutch Church of Port Richmond, and Wikipedia also notes that “After the closure in the 1880s of the South Reformed Dutch Church in Richmondtown the graves of that church&rsquo;s graveyard were reinterred at Moravian.”</p><p>I contacted Moravian Cemetery, and they had no record of James there.</p><p>Friends of Abandoned Cemeteries of Staten Island (FACSI), have <a href=http://richmond.nygenweb.net/facsi/facsi_cemeteries_m2.shtml>lists</a> of many Staten Island cemetery burials. There is a James C. W. Mills in Fountain Cemetery, who died at age 47 (FACSI ID 353), and a James Mills buried in the Fountain Cemetery Public Grounds who died 13 Jun 1889. There are also two unnamed Mills in Fountain Cemetery, in lot 080 and lot 095 (FACSI IDs 665 and 709 respectively), ages and death dates are unknown, but FACSI indicates that there are known burials in Fountain Cemetery from the 1860&rsquo;s, so these last two cannot be ruled out.</p><figure>
<blockquote>
<p>
Staten Island Cemetery about 1847 and Trinity Cemetery about 1800 both are located in West New Brighton.
</p><p>
...It is very difficult to find a burial from 1850 if it is not on any known burial list. The original records from Fountain & Staten Island cemetery are old and brittle. The burials prior to 1880 were not well kept and it seems semi literate recordings. There are very few documented deaths at that time as well. No death certificates were issued.
</p><p>
Children were not always buried by name. Staten Island Cemetery has an area for less expensive child burials, they are recorded as "lot of 5 childs" or Mrs. Mills child, John M's child, etc. If the child you are seeking was buried there, no exact record will be found.

Wood Library at Weill Cornell Medicine has records starting from 1854 from the Nursery and Child’s Hospital, and I contacted them about a search for James. This was a unlikelihood anyway, and became moot as even to search for him, they required the very information I was looking for: exact date of death, death certificate, etc., and even then, I would have to sign and agreement to de-identify the information, defeating the purpose.</p><p>(The Staten Island “country branch” of the hospital didn’t open until 1869.)</p><h2 id=exploring-wheelock>Exploring &ldquo;Wheelock&rdquo;</h2><p>Initially, I explored the theory that &ldquo;Wheelock&rdquo; could be a mis-transcription of the much less surprising &ldquo;Hallock&rdquo;, given how similar the two names might look written in script, however Kathleen Langdon&rsquo;s photographs of the originally written entry prove that wrong. However, I am still intrigued by the similarity of the two names, and they are even more similar phonetically, leading me to wonder if the church secretary misheard &ldquo;Hallock&rdquo; as &ldquo;Wheelock&rdquo;. Obviously this theory is purely speculation without evidence and can&rsquo;t be proved or disproved.</p><figure>
<blockquote>
<p>
The most common accepted definition of the name is as follows:
</p><p>
The name of the village is first recorded as <strong>Hoileck</strong>, and <strong>Hoiloch</strong> in the Domesday book then Changed in 1316 to Quelock and again in 1382 to Whelock, in 1384 to Welock, finally in 1390 it sees to have settled, and recorded as Wheelock as it is known today. The main reason for changes stem from people spelling as they sound it.
</p><p>
The word come from the word Chevel-og meaning winding, twisting, turning and the conclusions seem to be the river with its many twists and turns until they reach the central body of the river outside the village
</p><p>
The second but more obscure definition is as follows:
</p><p>
The development of Wellock via Wailock, Wallock from walok in 1379. This is the form which requires explanation and the evidence suggests that it was a diminutive of a personal or Christian name 'Wal'. This may have been meaningless when used in the 1300s, but etymologically it is probably the Old English word 'walh' meaning 'stranger' or 'foreigner'.

<p>
The surname Wheelock was first found in Cheshire as Wheelock, a township, in the parish of Sandbach, union of Congleton, hundred of Northwich.
</p><p>
The township dates back to the Domesday Book or 1086, when it was listed as <strong>Hoiloch</strong>, "named from the River Wheelock, a Celtic river-name meaning 'winding'".

</figcaption></figure><p>Assuming the name &ldquo;Wheelock&rdquo; is correct, as the evidence indicates, why was Wheelock chosen? Presumably he is named for someone, a tradition that was followed to an extreme by the Mills, yet through my exploration of not only the Mills genealogy, but those of many of the related families and even the families of business associates, fellow church members, etc., I have seen many thousands of individual names over dozens of family names on Long Island, and I don&rsquo;t recall encountering Wheelock even once.</p><p>Ironically, I have not yet thoroughly explored the Hallock genealogy, although I plan to, and this is obviously a current blind spot and a potential source for as-yet unfamiliar related names. But, setting the Hallock genealogy aside as a consideration for the moment, the lack of Wheelocks on Long Island could suggest that the name is more likely to be found on Staten Island, although I have also explored many individual and family names there as well, that exploration has not been nearly as deep as that for Long Island.</p><p>The distinctiveness of Wheelock should make finding the answer more likely. Like the Mills and Seaman names, Wheelock has English origins</p><figure>

</li></ul></aside></figure><p>I also considered the possibility that Wheelock was not referring to a relative or someone else the Mills knew personally, but a famous person of the time. Although I can&rsquo;t say this was never done in the Mills family, the overwhelming tradition was to reuse the same small set of names over many generations and even spanning across widely divergent branches of the family tree. Additionally the Wheelock I could find with any notoriety from the relevant time frame in America was Cyrus H. Wheelock:</p><figure>
