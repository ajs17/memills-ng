<p>James Wheelock Mills (1856?, Staten Island NY to between 31 July 1857 and 19 Jun 1860, Staten Island NY). The only evidence I have found for the existence of James Wheelock Mills is his baptism record in the Reformed Dutch Church of Port Richmond, Staten Island NY.</p><aside class=toc>

So, I believe that James died under five years old.</p><p>This would mean that the Mills left Staten Island within a few years of James&rsquo; death, just as they left Corfu a few years after Horace&rsquo;s. If my speculation holds, even if James died at the latest possible time, Emily would likely have not had memories of him.</p><p>Aside from his baptism record, I cannot find any other records for James in <em>The Records of the Reformed Protestant Dutch Church on Staten Island</em>, including many pages of gravestone transcriptions. Kathleen Langdon from the Reformed Dutch Church performed an independent search and also could not find him. Finally, I have also examined the First of Staten Island/Stapleton records on Ancestry.com, and I did not find evidence of the Mills there. Likewise, James is not within the volume: 1940, Cemetery Inscriptions from Hempstead, Long Island New York by Josephine C. Frost, familysearch.org.</p><p>I have not found James in any records on FindAGrave, FamilySearch, or Ancestry.</p><p>Decades after the Mills left Staten Island, members of Charles Pine&rsquo;s family were buried in Moravian Cemetery in New Dorp.</p><figure>
<blockquote>
<p>
Moravian Cemetery, located at 2205 Richmond Road, opened in 1740 and is the largest and oldest active cemetery on Staten Island.
</p><p>
In what was a purely farming community, the 113-acre (46 ha) cemetery was originally made available as a free cemetery for the public in order to discourage families from using farm burial plots. The Moravian Cemetery is the burial place for a number of famous Staten Islanders, including members of the Vanderbilt family.

There is a James C. W. Mills in Fountain Cemetery, who died at age 47 on 18 Apr 1893 (FACSI ID 353), and a James Mills buried in the row 5, grave 11 of the Fountain Cemetery Public Grounds who died 13 Jun 1889. There are also two unnamed Mills in Fountain Cemetery, in lot 080 and lot 095 (FACSI IDs 665 and 709 respectively), ages and death dates are unknown, but FACSI indicates that there are known burials in Fountain Cemetery from the 1860&rsquo;s, so these last two cannot be ruled out.</p><figure>
<blockquote>
<p>
Staten Island Cemetery about 1847 and Trinity Cemetery about 1800 both are located in West New Brighton.
</p><p>
...It is very difficult to find a burial from 1850 if it is not on any known burial list. The original records from Fountain & Staten Island cemetery are old and brittle. The burials prior to 1880 were not well kept and it seems semi literate recordings. There are very few documented deaths at that time as well. No death certificates were issued.
</p><p>
Children were not always buried by name. Staten Island Cemetery has an area for less expensive child burials, they are recorded as "lot of 5 childs" or Mrs. Mills child, John M's child, etc. If the child you are seeking was buried there, no exact record will be found.

However, I am still intrigued by the similarity of the two names, and they are even more similar phonetically, leading me to wonder if the church secretary misheard &ldquo;Hallock&rdquo; as &ldquo;Wheelock&rdquo;. Obviously this theory is purely speculation without evidence and can&rsquo;t be proved or disproved, but I present the following for consideration.</p><figure>
<blockquote>
Spelling variations of this family name include: Weelock, Wheelock, Wellock, Whellock, Whillock, Whealock and many more.

<p>
The surname Wheelock was first found in Cheshire as Wheelock, a township, in the parish of Sandbach, union of Congleton, hundred of Northwich.
</p><p>
The township dates back to the Domesday Book or 1086, when it was listed as <strong>Hoiloch</strong>, "named from the River Wheelock, a Celtic river-name meaning 'winding'".

<blockquote>
<p>
The most common accepted definition of the name is as follows:
</p><p>
The name of the village is first recorded as <strong>Hoileck</strong>, and <strong>Hoiloch</strong> in the Domesday book then Changed in 1316 to Quelock and again in 1382 to Whelock, in 1384 to Welock, finally in 1390 it sees to have settled, and recorded as Wheelock as it is known today. The main reason for changes stem from people spelling as they sound it.
</p><p>
The word come from the word Chevel-og meaning winding, twisting, turning and the conclusions seem to be the river with its many twists and turns until they reach the central body of the river outside the village
</p><p>
The second but more obscure definition is as follows:
</p><p>
The development of Wellock via Wailock, Wallock from walok in 1379. This is the form which requires explanation and the evidence suggests that it was a diminutive of a personal or Christian name 'Wal'. This may have been meaningless when used in the 1300s, but etymologically it is probably the Old English word 'walh' meaning 'stranger' or 'foreigner'.

</figcaption></figure><p>Similarly, many variations of the family name &ldquo;Hallock&rdquo; are known and were even used by the families within the Hallock genealogy. Records of the Mattituck Presbyterian Church, which Edward&rsquo;s grandfather Thomas attended as a young man prior to his marriage, contain multiple spellings of &ldquo;Hallock&rdquo; including &ldquo;Halloc&rdquo;, &ldquo;Halock&rdquo;, &ldquo;Haliock&rdquo;, &ldquo;Halliock&rdquo;, and even &ldquo;Hallaock&rdquo;. Records of the Smithtown Presbyterian Church, where several members of the Hallock family are listed as members, including Edward&rsquo;s grandparents later in life, also contain spelling variations, including both &ldquo;Hallock&rdquo; and &ldquo;Halliock&rdquo;. The Hallock family genealogists spent considerable effort accounting for this very issue:</p><figure class=image style=max-width:800px><img src=/family-of-edward-hallock-mills/assets/images/hallock/hallock-genealogy-tabulation-p13_huaed662cb9d0cb7ffb901b8ea38f84c25_399475_800x0_resize_q75_box.jpg width=800 height=463 alt><blockquote><p>Evidently the name was spelled by the sound. Few persons wrote or could write. The best scholars and authors spelled awkwardly. Orthography was in process of evolution. Chirography in business transactions was left to the clergy, scriveners, and clerks by principals, who took down phonetically the names as dictated. Pronouncing of proper names was not always clear or intelligible. It varied with individuals. Dialects were different according to districts and geographical location. Some individuals chopped their words, and some drawled. The name Holyoke seems to have been almost obsolete in American city directories and cyclopedias of biography. Quite recently, in 1888, one of the family living in England came over to America in quest of kinsfolk, and found few of the name, if any.</p><p>For two generations after the emigration, in 1630-40, the name of Holyoke persisted as spelled; thence onward continued variations took place. Just now, it is quite difficult for inquirers to find Hallocks in England or Holyokes in America.</p></blockquote><figcaption>

My initial expectation was that the distinctiveness of the Wheelock name would make it easier to find the answer. Presumably he is named for someone, a tradition that was followed to an extreme by the Mills, who tended to re-use a small pool of names repeatedly, and usually the names of those very close to them, yet I cannot find the name in the available genealogical data for the Mills, Pine, Hallock and Seaman families. The inverse is also true: a search of <em>The Wheelock family in America, 1637-1969</em> compiled by Walter T. Wheelock (familysearch.org), reveals one reference to an unrelated Mills family in Hartford CT, and no references whatsoever to the names Pine, Hallock or Seaman.</p><p>(For comparison, Horace&rsquo;s middle name &ldquo;Franklin&rdquo; is rare, but not unique in the Mills genealogy.)</p><p>Nor do I recall encountering Wheelock in the genealogical data I have reviewed for related families such as Hawkins and Brown, nor among the names of known business associates, fellow church members, etc., nor in the available census records I have reviewed, although admittedly, I only discovered James once I was a few years into this research, so I may have encountered the name at a time when it would not have caught my attention.</p><p>Searching more broadly for Wheelocks, in the 1800&rsquo;s, there are a number of Wheelocks in Brooklyn, central New York and Erie County. By 1890, there are Wheelocks in North Hempstead, notably, Daniel Wheelock, a farmer.</p><p>The Wheelocks living in Erie County, included in the following list, lived in Clarence at and around the time that the <a href=/family-of-edward-hallock-mills/mills-family/buffalo-mills/>Mills Family of Erie County</a> are living in Clarence, and Edward&rsquo;s family are in Staten Island and later Corfu in Genesee County, perhaps 10 miles from Clarence:</p><ul>

About that hour Peter Noony, a private watchman, observed three men standing abreast, in front of the hall through which the firm on the second floor have ingress and egress. Attracted by their unusual position, he went forward into the entrance, where he discovered their accomplice in act of appropriating a piece of print through a hole he had made in the glass partition. The other fellows, who had been screening him at the door, ran off, and the robber finding himself detected, darted out of the hall and down White-street, closely pursued by the watchman, by whom he was at length arrested, and placed in charge of Officer Northridge.</p></blockquote><figcaption>

Additionally the Wheelock I could find with any notoriety from the relevant time frame in America was Cyrus H. Wheelock:</p><figure>

Cyrus Hubbard Wheelock (February 28, 1813 – October 11, 1894) was an early missionary and leader in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. He wrote the words to the Latter-day Saint hymn "Ye Elders of Israel". Wheelock was born at Henderson, Jefferson County, New York.
