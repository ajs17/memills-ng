Church records are vague on the point, but it&rsquo;s quite likely he helped out irregularly over many months as the Congregational Church needed his services. In the Mills&rsquo; store sales journals, Emily notes paying Reverend Woodworth $3.00 for attending Edward&rsquo;s funeral.</li></ul></div></aside></figure><p><a href=https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/75958702/mary-ann-mills>Mary Ann</a> is interred at Evergreen Hill Cemetery, 112 Alleghany Rd, Corfu NY 14036.</p><h2 id=the-pines>The Pines</h2><p>I know of no formal histories or genealogies of the Pines, and initial searches starting with Mary Ann resulted in very little, so I have had to reconstruct this branch of the Pine tree from remaining documentary evidence. From the beginning, Charles M. Pine emerged as a central figure in the Mills&rsquo; lives, and the last name struck me as a very big coincidence. I assumed he was related to Mary Ann, and probably quite closely, and that a closer examination of Charles&rsquo; life would reveal much about the Mills. In time, I slowly compiled evidence proving that Mary Ann and Charles M. Pine were siblings. This fact alone explains much about the Mills&rsquo; lives.</p><p>My ability to make this connection was initially hindered by the fact that of the handful of member-created genealogies on ancestry.com that included Charles and referenced his parents, all showed his parents as some variation of:</p><ul>
<li>
<p><a href=https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/58487321/charles-l-pine>Charles L. Pine</a> (1785 to Apr 1853), whose relation to these Pines, if any, is presently unknown to me.</p></li><li>
<p>Sarah Soper (1787 to ?), a person I have otherwise been unable to identify. Her age is listed as 78 in 1865.</p></li></ul><p>(I will add that Charles M. Pines&rsquo; entries on these genealogies were very incomplete, so he was obviously not the focus of these trees.)</p><p>Before moving onto what I believe is overwhelming evidence that Charles M. Pine is Mary Ann&rsquo;s brother, I will try to account for this apparent discrepancy with Charles&rsquo; parents. It appears that the source of this error may be these entries in the 1865 New York State Census:</p><figure class=image style=max-width:800px><img src=/family-of-edward-hallock-mills/assets/images/pine/1865-census-nys_huef7460e2f8981069fa5c1ec857027020_1513775_800x0_resize_q75_box.jpg width=800 height=380 alt><figcaption>

Juliet was 20 in when the census was taken in 1865, matching the age of &ldquo;Julia&rdquo;. Her obituaries state that &ldquo;she was married to Mr. Shepard November 28, 1872&rdquo;, and so would still have the name Loper in 1865.</p><p>However, this may be somewhat obscured by two of Juliette&rsquo;s obituaries, that agree that &ldquo;her early life was spent in New York City, and following the death of her father in 1860, the family moved to this place [Huntington].&rdquo; Although, I would point out the vagueness of the relative time reference as well as the phrase &ldquo;the family&rdquo;.</p><div class=cols>

Shepard, editor of this paper, peacefully slept her life away Sunday morning at 9:30 o’clock. She died from paralysis, having had several shocks previous to the one Friday morning, which finally terminated in her death. Mrs. Shepard was born in Farmingdale, L. I. January 6, 1845, being the daughter of Erastus H. and Caroline Loper. Her early life was spent in New York City, and following the death of her father in 1860 the family moved to this place. She was married to Mr. Shepard November 28, 1872, and three children were born to them. George, the only son, died in childhood, and the other two survive, They are: Caroline, wife of Raymond S. Spears of Little Falls, N. Y., and Jessie L., an instructress in an institution for the blind in New York City. Mrs. Shepard also leaves two sisters, Mrs. William Sinell of Spring Valley, N. Y.; Mrs. Walter E. Bryant of this village, and two brothers, Edward H. Loper and William H. Loper, also of Huntington.</p><p>Early in life Mrs. Shepard united with the First Presbyterian Church and later, upon the inception of the Central Presbyterian Church, joined that organization. There are very few members, if any, who have been as devoted to the work of the church as Mrs. Shepard. As long as her health permitted she was a faithful attendant upon its services, and when she was unable to go her thoughts were centered upon the things of God’s house. Being enthusiastic upon the subject of missions, she was many years secretary and treasurer of the Ladies’ Missionary Society of the Central Presbyterian Church. Even up to the day of her death she was formulating plans along missionary lines. Her heart went out to the poor and many a local family will miss her little acts of kindness which she did without show or ostentation.</p><p>She was for many years a member of Dorcas Circle of King’s Daughters of this village, which sent a large number of gifts to the miners in Michigan and to the sick in hospitals and tenements, and she continuously sent supplies to city missions. She was also for many years an active worker for temperance in the ranks of the W. C. T. U, and a member of Ketewamoke Chapter, D. A. R.</p><p>The funeral services were held at the Central Presbyterian Church Tuesday afternoon at 2 o&rsquo;clock, the Rev. Samuel H. Seem being in charge.

Shepard, editor of the Huntington Long Islander, and a member of the Brooklyn Eagle’s reportorial staff, died on Sunday at her home in that village. Her death terminated a long period of failing health, and ended a serious illness of some days. Mrs. Shepard was born at Farmingdale on January 6, 1845, and was the daughter of Erastus H. and Caroline Loper. Her childhood was spent in the City of New York and in 1860, following the death of her father, the family removed to Huntington. She was married to Mr. Shepard on November 28, 1872. Three children were born to them, of whom two survive, a son haying died in childhood. The surviving children are Caroline, wife of Raymond S. Spears of Little Falls, N. Y., and Jessie L. Shepard, an instructress in the Institution for the Blind, in Manhattan. Mrs. Shepard in early life became a member of the First Presbyterian Church and later was one of the first members of the Central Church of Huntington. She was active in the work of that organization, and was prominent in connection with the Woman’s Home and Foreign Missionary Society, of which she was for a long period secretary, She had a wide acquaintance, and was highly regarded. Funeral services were held from the Central Church on Tuesday afternoon.</p></blockquote><figcaption>

<p>Lois Almy (Pine) Snedeker (1805? to 07 Nov 1890) married William Snedeker (sometimes spelled &ldquo;Snediker&rdquo;) in 1831 in South Hempstead.
