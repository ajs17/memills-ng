<p>That Edward was born in Smithtown NY is corroborated by two sources explored further below: Edward&rsquo;s marriage registration to Hannah in Caroline, and his obituary in the notes of Brookton Congregational Church. The 1875 New York State census only specifies Long Island as his birthplace. Generally speaking, whenever Smithtown is referenced in relation to the Mills, it is quite likely referring specifically to <a href=/family-of-edward-hallock-mills/topics/smithtown/>Mills Pond</a>.</p><p>The family&rsquo;s whereabouts in 1827 are given in the obituary of Edward&rsquo;s brother, James Thomas Mills:</p><figure>
<blockquote>
Mr. [James Thomas] Mills was not born in Suffolk County, but he was only two weeks and two days old when he first came to old Suffolk. He first saw the light of day at Cherry street, New York City, February 13, 1827. He was the son of Jonas D. Mills and Mary Hallock, a Smithtown woman, and before he was three weeks old, his parents came up to Smithtown on a large sailing vessel, to make their home.

<blockquote>
<p>
A wheelwright is a craftsman who builds or repairs wooden wheels. The word is the combination of "wheel" and the word "wright", (which comes from the Old English word "wryhta", meaning a worker or shaper of wood) as in shipwright and arkwright. This occupational name became the English surname Wright. It also appears in surnames like Cartwright and Wainwright. It corresponds with skilful metal workers being called Smith.
</p><p>
These tradesmen made wheels for carts (cartwheels), wagons (wains), traps and coaches and the belt drives of steam powered machinery. They also made the wheels, and often the frames, for spinning wheels for home use. First constructing the hub (called the nave), the spokes and the rim segments called felloes, (pronounced fell low), and assembling them all into a unit working from the center of the wheel outwards. Most wheels were made from wood, but other materials have been used, such as bone and horn, for decorative or other purposes.

</figcaption></figure><p>Ten years later, when Edward was approximately 18 years old, the Mills family moved to Hempstead NY, according to Jonas&rsquo; obituary. (10 Feb 1882, The Long-Islander, Huntington NY, p3, nyshistoricnewspapers.org.) It appears likely that Edward followed the rest of the family to Hempstead, as it is noted in the Hempstead Sentinel that Edward lived there at one time.</p><div class=cols>

<blockquote>
<p>If Hempstead were to be incorporated as a city, it would be the second-largest city in New York, behind New York City; it is about three times the size of Buffalo, which has long been the state's second-largest city. ...Hempstead is thus the most populous municipality in the New York metropolitan area outside New York City.
</p><p>
...During the American Revolution, the Loyalists in the south and the American sympathizers in the north caused a split in 1784 into "North Hempstead" and "South Hempstead". With the 1898 incorporation of the Borough of Queens as part of the city of New York, and the 1899 split of Queens County to create Nassau County, some southwestern portions of the Town of Hempstead seceded from the town and became part of the Borough of Queens.

</figcaption></figure><p>For Edward to move to Hempstead as a young man fits with other known facts and greatly adds to our understanding not only of his early adulthood, but the rest of his life. In Hempstead, Edward met two very important residents: Mary Ann Pine, who became Edward&rsquo;s first wife and mother of Emily Mills, and Mary Ann&rsquo;s brother, Charles M. Pine, who became Edward&rsquo;s employer and mentor in the grocery business.</p><p>A few years prior to the Mills&rsquo; move to Hempstead, Charles M. Pine was already living there, a newly married co-proprietor of the general store Weekes, Seaman & Pine. Hempstead was presumably when Edward&rsquo;s and Charles&rsquo; paths first crossed, and it would seem likely that Edward may have initially worked at Weekes, Seaman & Pine. To understand Edward&rsquo;s life, one must understand the life of Charles Pine, which Edward emulated in many ways.</p><figure class=image style=max-width:700px><img src=/family-of-edward-hallock-mills/assets/images/staten-island/1835-02-21-charles-pine_hub21a191e9c0d1ffd94725d1b86e50258_1262585_700x0_resize_q75_box.jpg width=700 height=368 alt><blockquote><p>Vol. V, No. 238 - February 21, 1835.</p><p>&mldr; In Hempstead, L.I., Mr. Charles Pine, of the firm of Weeks, Seaman & Pine to Almira Jane, daughter of Luther Loper. &mldr;</p></blockquote><figcaption>

The Trimming Square name was used between the early 19th Century and 1851, when the name was changed to Washington Square after George Washington. The name of the community was again changed in the 1870s when locals made strides to establish a local U.S. post office. The United States Postal Service would not use the name Washington Square, as they felt that there were too many other places within New York which had Washington in their names. This led to locals again changing the name, and they ultimately chose the name Franklin Square.

From Molly Adams&rsquo; research notes in the Caroline History Room: &ldquo;Walker Personius was a Civil War veteran and the village postmaster in 1882. He seems to have been the owner of Mott&rsquo;s original store which he called Personius Hall. The building had a large meeting space on the second floor, with seats that folded down from the wall. Memorial Day (then called Decoration Day) processions always formed in front of that building (see photo) and perhaps the David Ireland Post of Civil War Veterans met in that building. It seems clear that the post office was still at 559 Brooktondale Road in 1882.&rdquo; I don&rsquo;t know what photo was being referenced in the preceding passage. From &ldquo;Tour 3 - P8&rdquo; in A Drive-by Tour of the Town of Caroline: &ldquo;1st Post Office & store, left &ndash; 559 Brooktondale Road. We think this building was build by Mr. Mott, who owned most of the land at that time. &mldr;The G.A.R. lined up here to march to the [Quick, presently Brookton] cemetery to put flowers on the graves. There was a tannery between this house and the next before 1853 owned by Silsbury & Lounsbery.&rdquo; Walker Personius and Edward Lounsbery were also charter members of the Congregational Church of Mott&rsquo;s Corners, presently called Caroline Valley Community Church, and were instrumental in its formation. George Richardson, who appears to have worked for Edward Mills at a time when Edward was Postmaster, eventually started his own grocery business in &ldquo;the old Personius store&rdquo; starting May 1897.</li></ul></div></aside></figure></div><p>Mary Ann died on the eve of their 45th wedding anniversary.
