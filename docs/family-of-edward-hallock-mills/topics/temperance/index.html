                <p>The temperance movement was a significant cultural phenomenon of the mid 1800&rsquo;s to the early 1900&rsquo;s, and was particularly strong among the religious communities of upstate NY. There was significant overlap between members of the temperance movement and those supporting suffrage, and before that, abolition. Emily, Hannah and Ellen were all active in temperance.</p>

<p>Prior to the Mills moving to Mott&rsquo;s Corners, it is unclear if Emily or anyone else in the family was involved in temperance.</p>

Temperance groups don't appear to be very strong here. The only mention I found was the "Royal Templars of Temperance" who began meeting in 1878. They didn't seem to be very powerful. No date was given as to when they ceased to exist.

<p>There are records of a number of &ldquo;lodges&rdquo; of the Independent Order of Good Templars in the Batavia area. There was at least briefly a Corfu lodge of the Good Templars, although I don&rsquo;t yet know if Emily was a member there. This lodge apparently disbanded prior to 1885.</p>

<p>As the following news item suggests, the High Bridge Lodge in Mott&rsquo;s Corners was formed in March 1875, the year that the wooden trestle was being constructed, further suggesting that the trestle inspired the naming of the lodge, and not say &ldquo;upper bridge&rdquo;.</p>
<figure class="image" style="max-width:500px;"><img src="/family-of-edward-hallock-mills/assets/images/temperance/1878-03-12-Ithaca-Daily-Journal-Ithaca-NY-p4_hu15763aeebece638d82f05cb12240c822_109556_500x0_resize_box_3.png" width="500" height="1074" alt=""><blockquote><p>MOTT&rsquo;S CORNERS.</p>
<p>HIGH BRIDGE LODGE, NO. 296, I. O. of G. T.,</p>
<p>Celebrated their third anniversary by giving a public supper in their Lodge rooms, Friday evening, March 8th. It was largely attended and highly enjoyed by all. Especial credit is due Mrs. Josiah Shurtor and the young lady members of the lodge who superintended the refreshments. After supper the guests and members listed to some fine instrumental music by the Lodge Ban, conducted by Dr. Besemer. High Bridge Lodge is one of the largest and most successful Lodges in Tompkins County and is noted for its suppers also for its music, both vocal and instrumental, as all who have attended will bear your correspondent witness, and here allow me to say the Lodge will give a public entertainment in the Congregational Church, Wednesday evening, March 20. The programme will consist of the well known and popular drama, Rip Van Winkle, or the Sleepy Dutchman of the Catskill Mountains, also music, tableaux, &amp;c. The Lodge has spared no cost of pains in obtaining costumes and scenery to make this one of the first dramatic entertainments that has ever been presented to the public in this place. The scenery is all new and painted expressly for this play.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Utica, Ithaca and Elmira Railroad was later known as Elmira, Cortland and Northern Railroad. In 1905 it was absorbed by the Lehigh Valley Railroad. The tracks came out of Ithaca at East Hill up the north side of Six-Mile Creek valley, crossed Brookton on the trestle, crossed the DL&amp;W tracks at Caroline Junction, and continued on to Willseyville.</p>
<p>In 1874 the wooden trestle at Brookton was started, and completed in December 1875. It was made of foot-square timbers cut from area forests and set close together in several tiers 1600 feet long and 85 feet high. It was built for the Utica, Ithaca and Elmira Railroad. &ldquo;The wooden trestle required a watchman to cross it on foot after each train, just to make sure no fire had started anywhere in its timbers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As the old trestle weakened, it seemed so frightening that passenger trains stopped at the approach to either end and let fearful passengers walk across if they chose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In 1894 the wooden structure was replaced by one of steel. The work was done by Moses Hurlbut and his crew was quite remarkable, too, in that traffic was never completely stopped for the replacement. The metal bridge was placed without fully tearing down the old wooden one beforehand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The crew worked through the week preparing sections of the old trestle for removal and then, on Sunday, when no trains ran, a single span would be cut out and replaced. During the entire rebuilding program, not one train missed its schedule because of the trestle-builders&rsquo; activities.&quot;(Ithaca Journal&ndash;Glance Backward by Barbara Bell)</p>
<p>The steel trestle was about 800 feet long and 85 feet high at its highest point over the valley. It was called &ldquo;the new bridge&rdquo; and Lyman Gallagher of Slaterville said that &ldquo;old valley residents who had lived 50 years in the protection of that gigantic wooden windbreak, practically were blown out of their homesteads when the new steel bridge failed to stop the force of the winds up the valley.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lehigh Valley Railroad service was discontinued on 1 July 1935 on the old branch line over the stretch from Van Etten to East Ithaca. The &ldquo;last&rdquo; passenger train out of Ithaca to Owego over the 110 year old Cayuga-Susquehanna &amp; Western branch of the Delaware, Lackawanna &amp; Western Railroad, was on Palm Sunday and in short order, the trestle was taken down by a small crew of Bethlehem Steel company workmen.</p>

<p>The &ldquo;Great Iron Bridge at Brookton&rdquo; in the photograph below replaced the wooden trestle and was dismantled in the final years of Emily&rsquo;s life. A version of the following postcard can be found on page 57 in <em>The Towns of Tompkins County: From Podunk to the Magnetic Springs</em> edited by Jane Marsh Dieckmann, which states it was taken in 1907, when Edward Mills was still alive. Note that the photographer is standing on or very near the &ldquo;brow of the hill&rdquo; that forms the western boundary of the Mills&rsquo; Home parcel. I have tried to recreate this photograph to get a more exact idea of where the photographer was standing, but the view is now obscured by trees, making it difficult. However, I think that the photographer was in the general area of the concrete marker on the hill brow as the hill starts descending back toward Brooktondale Road, above where the concrete retaining wall is presently. That concrete marker is represented on the survey maps of 475 Brooktondale Road.</p>

<li>Although impossible to say with certainty, several aspects of this notice suggest to me that it could have been written by Emily.</li>
<li>The text of the poem is the first four lines of &ldquo;Rest&rdquo; by Mary T. Lathrap (commonly cited as Latrhop), a nationally recognized temperance leader in the late 1800&rsquo;s. According to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Torrans_Lathrap">Wikipedia</a>: &ldquo;Mary Torrans Lathrap née, Torrans; (pen name, Lena; April 25, 1838 - January 3, 1895), known as &ldquo;The Daniel Webster of Prohibition&rdquo;, was a 19th-century American poet, preacher, suffragist, and temperance reformer. For 20 years, she was identified with the progressive women of Michigan who had temperance, purity, and prohibition as their watchwords, and the white ribbon as their badge. A licensed preacher for the Methodist Episcopal Church (1871), she served as president of Michigan&rsquo;s Woman&rsquo;s Christian Temperance Union (1882), co-founded the state&rsquo;s suffrage organization (1870), and worked on the amendment campaign (1874). Lathrap died in 1895.&rdquo; Note the parallels to Annis Ford Eastman. This poem has been used often in obituaries since it was penned, either in part or in its entirety, and it was obviously a fitting tribute to Hannah&rsquo;s life.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/98809451/charles-bogardus">Reverend Elder Charles Bogardus</a> (19 Nov 1843 to 12 Oct 1925). In the 1870 census, he is a farmer in Caroline, but he later became a Baptist minister residing in Brookton. &ldquo;For 20 or more years he was pastor of five churches visiting them once each month.&rdquo; (17 Oct 1925, The Ithaca Journal, Ithaca NY, p5.) &ldquo;He was one of the best known clergymen in this section and many couples now residing here, began their married life with his blessing. He was also called upon to officiate at many funerals. He was well-known as Elder Bogardus.&rdquo; (12 Oct 1925, The Ithaca Journal, Ithaca NY, p5.)</li>
<li>Notice that in the 1870 United States Federal Census, both Hannah and then husband Charles Eastman both have checks in the columns labelled &ldquo;Cannot read.&rdquo; and &ldquo;Cannot write.&rdquo;, although presumably this is inaccurate, as Hannah is described as “a great reader”.</li>

&lt;li&gt;It is interesting to note that the Brookton chapter of the W.C.T.U. was organized in 1907, the same year that Jessie Shurter and Emily Mills were baptized and officially joined the membership roll of Brookton Congregational Church. Emily is listed as Superintendent of Literature and Publications. Many of her neighbors are listed beside her: Jessie Shurter (later Jessie Brewer) Mrs. Dr. B. F. Lockwood, Mrs. Daniel Mason and Anna Mulks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It seems that Anna Mulks is listed as both Mrs. Charles Mulks and Mrs. Anna Mulks?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sixty five members strikes me as quite a large number of Christian women supporting temperance for such a small area, especially considering there were a number of other chapters very close by, in Danby for example.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
