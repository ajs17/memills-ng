                <p>Emily, Hannah and Ellen were each known to be active in temperance, primarily in the Women&rsquo;s Christian Temperance Union (W.C.T.U.), although Emily was also a member of the Independent Order of Good Templars. The temperance movement was a significant cultural phenomenon of the mid 1800&rsquo;s to the early 1900&rsquo;s, and was particularly strong among the religious communities of upstate NY. There was significant overlap between members of the temperance movement and those supporting suffrage, and before that, abolition.</p>

<p>&ldquo;High Bridge Lodge is one of the largest and most successful Lodges in Tompkins County and is noted for its suppers also for its music, both vocal and instrumental&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have an orchestra in connection with our new lodge&hellip;Their choice selections of instrumental music interspersed through the business part of the meetings tend to greatly enliven us. We also boast of having as fine a band of singers as can be found in this part of the country.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Emily Mills joined the existing “High Bridge Lodge No. 296” of the Independent Order of Good Templars shortly after arriving in Mott’s Corners, as she &ldquo;furnished entertainment for the good of the order&rdquo; in August 1879. (20 Aug 1879, Ithaca Daily Journal, Ithaca NY, p4.) She was a member until at least August 1886, as attested by the meeting minutes of the Good Templars at that time. She often contributed to the “Good of the Order” portions of meetings in which members volunteered in advance to contribute something of educational and/or entertainment value, such as reading a poem or essay. At different times, she held offices in the lodge, such as secretary, as indicated below.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The International Organisation of Good Templars (IOGT; founded as the Independent Order of Good Templars), whose international body is known as Movendi International, is a fraternal organization which is part of the temperance movement, promoting abstinence from alcohol and other drugs. …The IOGT originated as one of a number of fraternal organizations for temperance or total abstinence founded in the 19th century and with a structure modeled on Freemasonry, using similar ritual and regalia. Unlike many, however, it admitted men and women equally, and also made no distinction by race. The IOGT named themselves after the Knights Templar, citing the legend that the original knights &ldquo;drank sour milk, and also because they were fighting &lsquo;a great crusade&rsquo; against &rsquo;this terrible vice&rsquo; of alcohol.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Fayetteville discovered to be the Birthplace of the Order.</p>
<p>The Fayetteville Recorder has made the discovery that Fayetteville was the birthplace of the Independent Order of Good Templars. It seems says the Recorder, &ldquo;that in 1851 eleven lodges of &ldquo;Good Templars&rdquo; (so-called) existed in Oneida county, and another, known as &ldquo;Excelsior Lodge No. 14,&rdquo; was started in Syracuse, meeting in a hall on the fourth floor of the Empire House. At a convention of this order held in Utica in July, 1852, Levrett E. Coon and T. S. Truair, delegates from &ldquo;Excelsior Lodge,&rdquo; considered themselves aggrieved by the action of the convention, and withdrew therefrom, and their course was approved by the Syracuse lodge. At this time William J. Stoddard of Excelsior Lodge had corresponded with some young men of this village and on July 17, 1852, in Academy Hall, he met and obligated James H. Eaton, Edward P. Clark, Jewett J. Dunbar, Augustus Tremaine and W. H. Goodrich. On July 20, Tuesday evening, Levrett Coon came to this village and gave the obligation to six other young men, and organized them into a lodge of the &ldquo;Independent Order of Good Templars,&rdquo; he having withdrawn from the Oneida county organization.</p>
<p>The new lodge, while using to some extent the ritual of the Oneida county organization, made several important changes therein and in the secret work, to separate and distinguish if from the &ldquo;Good Templar.&rdquo; The following persons were elected officers of the new organization: W.C.T., James H. Eaton; W.V.T., Ansell Prescott; recording secretary, Jewett J. Dunbar; treasurer, Augustus Tremaine; financial secretary, Wm. H. Goodrich; M., Edward P. Clark; D.M., Calvin P. Clark; chaplain, Daniel Rider; O.G., C. J. McMyman; I. G., Wm. Johnson; P.W.C.T., Orrin D. Torrey.</p>
<p>These officers were at once installed. Therefore James H. Eaton was the first chief templar of the I.O.G.T. The charter of this lodge, which was called &ldquo;Eureka Lodge, No. 2,&rdquo; is now in the office of D. W. Hooker, secretary of the Grand Lodge of New York state in the White Memorial building in Syracuse. On his return to Syracuse Mr. Coon succeeded in getting the Excelsior Lodge to withdraw from the &ldquo;Good Templars&rdquo; and become &ldquo;Excelsior Lodge, No. 1, I.O.G.T.,&rdquo; although the number really belonged to the Fayetteville Lodge.</p>
<p>The new order spread rapidly, but owing to constitutional defects the Oneida county organization had life for only about two years. &ldquo;Eureka Lodge&rdquo; was represented in the Grand Lodge for three or four years, and then appears to have died a natural death, although the order of which it was the parent organization still continues to flourish.</p>
<p>The order which in 1852 was founded by 11 young men now contains about 725,000 members.</p>

<p>Prior to the Mills moving to Mott&rsquo;s Corners, it is unclear if Emily Mills or anyone else in the family was involved in temperance.</p>

Temperance groups don't appear to be very strong here. The only mention I found was the "Royal Templars of Temperance" who began meeting in 1878. They didn't seem to be very powerful. No date was given as to when they ceased to exist.

<p>There are records of a number of &ldquo;lodges&rdquo; of the Independent Order of Good Templars in the Batavia area. There was at least briefly a Corfu lodge of the Good Templars, although I don&rsquo;t yet know if Emily was a member there. This lodge apparently disbanded prior to 1885.</p>

<p>As will be seen, a lodge described as being in a &ldquo;very flourishing condition&rdquo; was a common refrain used over the years and in many locations of the Good Templars, whose members were encouraged to advertise their lodges, such as with regular newspaper updates.</p>

<p>The temperance movement in Tompkins County appeared to explode in growth between 1875 and 1880 in particular, with over 1000 members county-wide at the end of that period. Although the Ithaca Union Lodge appeared to be strong well into the early 1900&rsquo;s, many lodges that were considered very strong, such as those in Danby, Freeville and Mclean all became inactive and years later, newspaper accounts tell of the local citizens trying to form new lodges of the Good Templars in these places.</p>

<p>Other known locations that at one time had lodges of the Good Templars include Speedsville, Danby, Ithaca and Dryden, to name a few. And there were a number of other temperance organizations strongly represented in the county, including the Royal Templars of Temperance, the Sons of Temperance, and eventually, the Women&rsquo;s Christian Temperance Union.</p>
<p>In early August 1877, temperance leader Francis Murphy visited Ithaca on one of his lecture tours, which created excitement around &ldquo;Murphy Meetings&rdquo;. Days before Francis Murphy&rsquo;s arrival, Caroline lost one of its strongest temperance leaders, <a href="https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/100594864/josiah-shurter">Josiah Shurter</a> (26 Apr 1815 to 05 Aug 1877), a former owner of the Mills&rsquo; Store property, and the grandfather of Jessie Brewer, who was born four years after Josiah died. Josiah’s widow <a href="https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/100594934/jane-shurter">Jane (Shutt) Shurter</a> (21 Nov 1825 to 23 Jun 1897) was a member of Good Templars Lodge at Mott’s Corners.</p>

<p>The &ldquo;High Bridge Lodge&rdquo; No. 296 at Mott&rsquo;s Corners appears to have formed in March 1876, and held their meetings in Lounsbery Hall, the venue above Mills&rsquo; Store. Edward and Amanda Lounsbery, themselves members of the High Bridge Lodge, purchased the Mills&rsquo; Store property on 12 Oct 1874, when the store was still operated by George Sanders.</p>

<p>Some twenty more are to unite with them at their next meeting, thus giving them strength to commence the good work at once.</p>

<p>HIGH BRIDGE LODGE, NO. 296, I. O. of G. T.,</p>
<p>Celebrated their third anniversary by giving a public supper in their Lodge rooms, Friday evening, March 8th. It was largely attended and highly enjoyed by all. Especial credit is due Mrs. Josiah Shurtor and the young lady members of the lodge who superintended the refreshments. After supper the guests and members listed to some fine instrumental music by the Lodge Band, conducted by Dr. Besemer. High Bridge Lodge is one of the largest and most successful Lodges in Tompkins County and is noted for its suppers also for its music, both vocal and instrumental, as all who have attended will bear your correspondent witness, and here allow me to say the Lodge will give a public entertainment in the Congregational Church, Wednesday evening, March 20. The programme will consist of the well known and popular drama, Rip Van Winkle, or the Sleepy Dutchman of the Catskill Mountains, also music, tableaux, &amp;c. The Lodge has spared no cost of pains in obtaining costumes and scenery to make this one of the first dramatic entertainments that has ever been presented to the public in this place. The scenery is all new and painted expressly for this play.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Besemer Cornet Band, of Motts Corners, consists of thirteen pieces and is in a flourishing condition. It was organized about three months ago.&rdquo; (22 Dec 1880, Ithaca Daily Journal, Ithaca NY, p4, see also 29 Sep 1880, p4.)</p>
<figure class="image" style="max-width:800px;"><img src="/family-of-edward-hallock-mills/assets/images/temperance/1879-05-28-Ithaca-Daily-Journal-Ithaca-NY-p4_huf97f7247fd09828b00885240ef9b6278_977654_800x300_fill_box_top_3.png" width="800" height="300" alt=""><blockquote><p>GOOD-TEMPLAR SPLINTERS.</p>
<p>There are fourteen Good-Templar lodges in the county distributed through the various towns as follows: Ithaca, 1; Lansing, 1; Dryden, 4; Groton, 2; Caroline, 4; Danby, 1; Newfield, 1; while Enfield and Ulysses have none.</p>
<p>There are also two juvenile temples in the county; one in Ithaca and one in Slaterville.</p>
<p>The town of Caroline is the &ldquo;banner town&rdquo; of the county; Lansing has the largest lodge, while every lodge, we hope is the <em>best</em> lodge.</p>
<p>One of the most flourishing lodges in the county is Progress, No 93, of Freeville. For two or three years they were sickly enough &ldquo;up there&rdquo; but about two quarters ago they went to work and began to carry out the principles of our order, and to make their lodge a home for reformed men, and in this short time they have more than doubled their numbers. They had one initiation last Saturday evening. There is one truth, at least, supported by the history of this lodge, and that is &ldquo;As soon as people see that an organization is helping and saving men, they give it their support.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There have been eight members initiated into Ithaca Union Lodge this quarter and the quarter is only three weeks old. Can any lodge show a better report so far? If so, let us hear from you soon, for they will swell that number next week.</p>
<p>This lodge also held a very pleasant sociable in their rooms last Tuesday evening, and have a festival in view in the near future.</p>
<p>We have received the following communication from the Secretary of High Bridge Lodge, No. 296, of Motts Corners: &ldquo;It can truly be said that High Bridge Lodge is in a very flourishing condition. The regular weekly meetings are very interesting and well attended even at this busy season. The following are our officers for the present quarter: W. C. T., John McWhorter; W. V. T., Mrs. F. G. Ault; W. S., Geo. G. Depuy; W. A. S., Miss Ellen Allen; W. M., M. D. Shaw; W. D. M., Mrs. Geo. G. Depuy; W. F. S., Geo. E. Vandemark; W. T., F. G. Ault; W. C., Arthur Denman; W. I. G., Stephen Voorhis; W. O. G., Mrs. Dr. Besemer; R. H. S., Miss Cinthia Vorhis; L. H. S., Miss Gussie Merrill.</p>
<p>We have an orchestra in connection with our new lodge, consisting of the following members: Geo. G. Depuy, 1st violin; Dr. M. Besemer, 2nd violin; W. T. Graham, organist; John McWhorter, bass viol; J. P. Merrill, guitar. Their choice selections of instrumental music interspersed through the business part of the meetings tend to greatly enliven us. We also boast of having as fine a band of singers as can be found in this part of the country.</p>
<p>The lodge has recently purchased a new organ of the Ithaca Organ Company, of which we have every reason to be proud.</p>
<p>Our list of members comprises many of the wealthy and influential men and women of this vicinity, such as Moses T. Denman and family, Wm. Hungerford and family, Rev. Geo. Brown, Edward Lounsbery and wife, etc., all of whom are good workers in the cause of temperance, and prove their interest in our lodge by their regular attendance and willingness to take an active part in the exercises at all times. Our membership at present is about seventy, and more are being added to the ranks almost weekly. Our lodge has already done much good in this village. We have some genuine &ldquo;reformed men&rdquo; with us who by their faithfulness to the lodge and its principles prove that they are in earnest.</p>
<p>Our lodge meets each Friday evening in Lounsbery&rsquo;s Hall, where we are always pleased to have visitors from other lodges call and lend us a helping hand or speak for us a few words of encouragement. Hoping to hear from some our sister lodges through these columns I remain yours fraternally,</p>
<p>Geo. G. Depuy, W. Sec.</p>
<p>The Sec. of Temperance Star, No. 384, of Caroline Centre, says that this lodge is in a more prosperous condition than ever before.</p>
<p>There have been three initiations since county lodge was held at Slaterville, and still others who have sent in their names. The lodge edits a paper entitled &ldquo;The Temperance Herald,&rdquo; the regular appearance of which is looked forward to with much pleasure. The next number is to be read before the lodge Saturday evening, May 31st.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Ithaca Piano &amp; Organ Company was established in 1877 by William Bostwick and Henry Wegman as successors to The Swiss Organ Company.  The firm was first listed as the “Ithaca Organ Company” and was a division of the “Ithaca Calendar Clock Company”, makers of clocks and other small mechanical devices.  Alonzo Cornell, son of Ezra Cornell (founder of Cornell University) was principal financial backer of the firm.</p>
<p>The Ithaca Piano &amp; Organ Company built a limited number of very elaborately styled parlor organs and lavishly carved upright and square pianos.  Instruments by the Ithaca Piano &amp; Organ Company were of very good quality and are quite rare today.  The Ithaca Piano &amp; Organ Company went out of business in 1885.</p>

<p>Just before 1888 was the golden day of Ithaca’s manufacturing. A cluster of mills at the foot of Fall creek’s Ithaca Falls was turning out paper, guns, agricultural implements, plaster, pottery and flour. Down in the Inlet section, in the city’s First Ward, things were even busier. An old First Ward resident recalled the days.</p>
<p>“The Ithaca Organ Company was the biggest thing in the Inlet section at that time,” he said. “It started in a little wooden building on the south side of the creek and later came across and put up a brick building on the east side. They made organs on the west side and pianos on the east. They employed about 300 men at one time. About 1885, though, the business went to pieces through mismanagement. When it was going, Ithaca organs and pianos were well known and pedalled throughout the country. Every farmhouse had an Ithaca organ for miles around here. At one time the company got Wegman, the German piano man, to come here and look after the business but he went to Auburn and set up business for himself. You&rsquo;ve heard of Wegman pianos.</p>

<p>As one might suspect, High Bridge Lodge was named for the wooden trestle at Mott’s Corners, which had just been completed in December 1875, a few months prior to the formation of High Bridge Lodge, in March 1876. The following news item is the last mention I have yet found of the existence of the High Bridge Lodge.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Utica, Ithaca and Elmira Railroad was later known as Elmira, Cortland and Northern Railroad. In 1905 it was absorbed by the Lehigh Valley Railroad. The tracks came out of Ithaca at East Hill up the north side of Six-Mile Creek valley, crossed Brookton on the trestle, crossed the DL&amp;W tracks at Caroline Junction, and continued on to Willseyville.</p>
<p>In 1874 the wooden trestle at Brookton was started, and completed in December 1875. It was made of foot-square timbers cut from area forests and set close together in several tiers 1600 feet long and 85 feet high. It was built for the Utica, Ithaca and Elmira Railroad. &ldquo;The wooden trestle required a watchman to cross it on foot after each train, just to make sure no fire had started anywhere in its timbers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As the old trestle weakened, it seemed so frightening that passenger trains stopped at the approach to either end and let fearful passengers walk across if they chose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In 1894 the wooden structure was replaced by one of steel. The work was done by Moses Hurlbut and his crew was quite remarkable, too, in that traffic was never completely stopped for the replacement. The metal bridge was placed without fully tearing down the old wooden one beforehand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The crew worked through the week preparing sections of the old trestle for removal and then, on Sunday, when no trains ran, a single span would be cut out and replaced. During the entire rebuilding program, not one train missed its schedule because of the trestle-builders&rsquo; activities.&quot;(Ithaca Journal&ndash;Glance Backward by Barbara Bell)</p>
<p>The steel trestle was about 800 feet long and 85 feet high at its highest point over the valley. It was called &ldquo;the new bridge&rdquo; and Lyman Gallagher of Slaterville said that &ldquo;old valley residents who had lived 50 years in the protection of that gigantic wooden windbreak, practically were blown out of their homesteads when the new steel bridge failed to stop the force of the winds up the valley.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lehigh Valley Railroad service was discontinued on 1 July 1935 on the old branch line over the stretch from Van Etten to East Ithaca. The &ldquo;last&rdquo; passenger train out of Ithaca to Owego over the 110 year old Cayuga-Susquehanna &amp; Western branch of the Delaware, Lackawanna &amp; Western Railroad, was on Palm Sunday and in short order, the trestle was taken down by a small crew of Bethlehem Steel company workmen.</p>

<p>The &ldquo;Great Iron Bridge at Brookton&rdquo; in the photograph below replaced the wooden trestle and was dismantled in the final years of Emily&rsquo;s life. A version of the following postcard can be found on page 57 in <em>The Towns of Tompkins County: From Podunk to the Magnetic Springs</em> edited by Jane Marsh Dieckmann, which states it was taken in 1907, when Edward Mills was still alive. Note that the photographer is standing on or very near the &ldquo;brow of the hill&rdquo; that forms the western boundary of the Mills&rsquo; Home parcel. I have tried to recreate this photograph to get a more exact idea of where the photographer was standing, but the view is now obscured by trees, making it difficult. However, I think that the photographer was in the general area of the concrete marker on the hill brow as the hill starts descending back toward Brooktondale Road, above where the concrete retaining wall is presently. That concrete marker is represented on the survey maps of 475 Brooktondale Road.</p>

<p>Tuesday evening Nov. 14th a lecture was delivered by A. S. Draper, after which a number were initiated for the Slaterville Lodge. The following questions were very ably discussed during the session, from which those present derived great benefit:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Duty of the church as relates to Good Templars.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How can we as a County Lodge best keep up the interest and promote the interest in the county?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How can we keep up the interest in subordinate Lodges.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What is the duty of the Good Templars as relates to juvenile Templars?</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The report of the Lodges shows the number to be about the same as last quarter.</p>

<p>[Compiled for the Journal.]</p>
<p>—County Lodge will be held Thursday and Friday, August 7th and 8th with Ithaca Union Lodge, No. 295. Don’t forget to elect your delegates and then see that they attend.</p>
<p>—Elect your best members for delegates to the County Lodge.</p>
<p>—Remember that the County Lodge will attend the Spencer camp meeting in a body, and in full regalia Friday, August 8th. If you can’t come to Ithaca Thursday, go to Spencer Friday and be sure and take your regalia. Faithful Lodge of North Lansing expects to send a large delegation; and if this lodge, the farthest from Spencer of any lodge in the county does so well, surely the other lodges will do well also, and there will be a grand rally around our colors. Among those to be present at Spencer and deliver addresses are A. S. Draper, G.W.C.T.; the Rev. Henry Ward, P.G.W.C.T., Mrs. M. B. O’Donnell, and: John N. Stearns, Esq. Meetings will be held under the auspices of the Order in the morning, afternoon and evening.</p>
<p>—It is almost time for another quarterly election. All W.C.T.&rsquo;s W.V.T.’s, W.S&rsquo; and W.T.’s must be full degree members. The other officers need not have taken either degree.</p>
<p>—It is not proper to install by proxy. If an officer elect is absent at time of installation, elect another and go ahead.</p>
<p>—Lodges will bear it in mind to recommend a suitable member for L.D. at the time of the next election of officers. A suitable one will be the best one you have got. Send in the recommendation promptly.</p>
<p>—Ithaca Union Lodge is making preparation to care for a host at the county lodge. Be sure to come so that they will not be disappointed.</p>
<p>—One initiation at Ithaca Union last week.</p>
<p>—High Bridge Lodge, No. 296, of Motts Corners has elected the following delegates and alternates to represent them at the County Lodge session. Regulars: E. Lounsbery, Wm. Montgomery and M. D. Shaw. Alternates: Mrs. Dr. Besemer, Mrs. J. P. Merrill and Wm. Hungerford.</p>
<p>—Lodges will please be prompt in sending in delegates’ credentials before the opening of the first day&rsquo;s session of the County Lodge, or at least let the delegates see that their credentials are in during the first half hour of the meeting; also send duplicates to the county secretary. The duplicates are the postal cards received by the W.S.&rsquo;s. Also let the delegates be <em>particularly sure</em> to bring a copy of the lodge deputy’s report. If anything should possibly happen so that a lodge cannot be represented, send a copy of the deputy&rsquo;s report to the county secretary.</p>
<p>—All who attend County Lodge, delegates or visitors are urgently requested to furnish their own regalias.</p>
<p>—Don&rsquo;t go hunting around town for the place you want on County Lodge day. The right place is Temperance Hall, opposite Journal block, over Stevens’ marble works.</p>
<p>—Remember that County Lodge begins at 10 o&rsquo;clock, A.M., and not at 11 or even half past ten. Let every delegate be on hand promptly at the hour if a possible thing. I believe now I have said my say about County Lodge. At least I don’t think of any other <em>orders</em> I want to give just at present. But I did want to say just what I have said to every member in the order. If any one wants to have any fuller particulars let him apply to the County Secretary and he will answer more minutely. I don’t want to hear any one say that they didn&rsquo;t understand fully about the County Lodge, as I have heard them say before now.</p>
<p>—We hear as follows from High Bridge Lodge, No. 296, Of Motts’ Corners: &ldquo;We had a full attendance, owing partly to election of officers and also to a growing interest in our meetings. We had one initiation, also one last week.” The names of the delegates and alternates from the various lodges will be given next week.</p>
<p>County Secretary.</p>

<p>–The Grand Lodge is to be held this year at the Thousand Islands, one of the finest pleasure grounds in world. [sic] The fare from Syracuse for a round trip is only two dollars and fifty cents. If enough from this county attend, the fare from Ithaca and return will not exceed four dollars. These will be the cheapest excursion rates that have ever been given to the Thousand Islands. There is no reason why a large number from this vicinity should not attend, and it is especially important that every lodge be represented at the Grand Lodge this year, for business of the greatest importance to the Order is to be transacted.</p>

<p>—Faithful, No. 63, of North Lansing has just elected and installed a fine corps of officers for the ensuing quarter. It will be noticed that they have filled the W.C.T.’s chair with a lady and the W.V.T.’s with a gentleman, which change is a good one to make occasionally. We give the officers below:</p>
<p>Mrs. L. J. Townley, W.C.T.; J. S. Osmun, W.V.T.; L. J. Townley, W.S.; Miss Minnie Brown, W.F.S.; Denton Lobdell, W.T.; Wm. H. Buckley, W.C.; Frank Singer, W.M.; Mrs. Wm. Wilcox, W.I.G.; Abram Armstrong, W.O.G. Frank Tarbell received the recommendation for Lodge Deputy for the ensuing year. Frank Tarbell, J. S. Osmun and L. J. Townley were elected delegates to the session of the County Lodge.</p>
<p>Diligent Lodge, No. 137, of Peruville, installed the following officers on Saturday evening last for the quarter ending Nov. 1, 1879:</p>
<p>W.C.T., J. P. Moe; W.V.T., Mate Fox; W. Sec., Rich Morgan; W.F.S., Charley Gross; W.T., M. J. Larned;W.C., Emma Moe; W.M., Eugene Moe; W.I.G.; Sarah Johnson; W.O.G., A. C. McLachlan; W.A. Sec., Nettie Darling; W.D.M., Viola Searles; W.R.S., Ida Van Marter; W.L.S., Hattie Steele; T. R. Page was recommended for L.D. for the ensuing year.</p>
<p>–At the regular meeting of Crystal Fountain lodge, No. 234, of Slaterville, Saturday evening, the following officers were installed by Bro. Lounsbery of High Bridge lodge: W.C.T., C. H. Stephans; W.V.T., Emma Avery; W.S., Elosia Landon; W.F.S., Omar Earsley; W.T., James Mulks; W.C., J. H. Smiley; W.M., Jay Phillips; W.G., Geo. Haynes; W. Sent., Ora Delaney; D.M., Clara Higgins; A.S., Alonzo Carle; R.H.S., Mary Harding; L.H.S., Jennie Smith.</p>
<p>—The list of new officers for High Bridge lodge, No. 296, was sent last week, but, on account of the press of other matter, we were unable to publish it at that time, and laid it by for this week; but evidently we put it in too secure a place since we are unable to find it when wanted. IF the secretary of that lodge will send us another list in his next communication, we will take care that is has a watchful eye kept on it.</p>
<p>–One initiation at Ithaca Union, No. 295, again last week.</p>
<p>MOTTS’ CORNERS</p>
<p>–S. B. Landon has returned from the West, having purchase 160 acres of land in Dickinson County, Kansas. He expects to go thither with his family some time this fall or winter. Will Heath started last week for Abilene, Kansas to put in Mr. Landon’s winter wheat, and take charge of his mules, etc. Quite and undertaking for a boy who never had been west of Elmira before.</p>
<p>–Rev. Geo. Brown announced last Sunday that there would be no services on Sunday evenings during the month of August. It was quite [sic] surprise and disappointment to many, especially the young folks.</p>
<p>–F. G. Ault has his cellar complemented and expects to soon be the owner and occupant of a new house, it is pleasantly situated and will be an ornament to our village.</p>
<p>–Jusus Heath has his new blacksmith shop enclosed, and the sound of the hammer and anvil will soon be heard within its walls.</p>
<p>–Geo. G. DePuy has the lumber and material on the spot preparatory to repairing and beautifying his house, and so the work goes on.</p>
<p>–A number of fresh items may be expected soon from this town, but we will not mention them yet as it might discourage the coming census taker.</p>

<p>Compiled for the Journal.</p>
<p>–Members of the Order going to the Grand Lodge will start Monday morning, Aug. 25.</p>
<p>–There was one initiation, and two received by card, at Ithaca Union Lodge one week ago Wednesday evening. They also installed a good corps of officers that evening. Under the good of the order some very encouraging words were given by Rev. and sister Lousbery [sic] of High Bridge lodge.</p>
<p>–Owing to our absence for the last week the Good Templar news for this week will be rather limited. During our absence we have had a chance to learn something about Good Templarism in Orange county. The Orange county lodge met last Thursday in Middletown, and from the reports given we would say that county was doing nicely. For some time back, the order there has been damaging itself and the cause of temperance by internal dissensions. But now they have settled down to the fight against the common foe, and the result is that the Order is doing once more a good work in “Old Orange”. We feel some interest in the cause of Good Templarism there, because it was in the county that we were first led into a Good Templar’s lodge. Since that time, nearly four years ago, we have found what a great and grand order we were a member of and have been led to enter more fully into its work. But we want to say a word right here, in regard to what many call a failure in the workings of our order. The lodge that we first united with, after working a couple of years, went down for various causes. People said that “they told you so,” and “they knew Good Templarism would never amount to anything,” and so on <em>ad infinitum</em>. But let us see what that lodge really did do. Last spring a few of the young men who had belonged to the old lodge, and had there had the finest principles, that are so thoroughly taught by our order, fastened indelibly upon their minds, young men who before they entered the lodge were the most careless of the careless in regard to temperance; a few such young men as that got together, called a temperance meeting, nominated a no-license excise commissioner, worked for him at the polls and elected him by a good majority. Can any one say, in the face of such things as these, that any lodge was ever instituted in vain? Nay! but I tell you that no lodge was ever instituted, no matter how short lived it may have been, but that the cause of temperance was advanced. We sometimes get discouraged, and seem to feel when we hear of members leaving the order, that somehow our work has proved a failure. But instead, could we look at it as it really is, we would find that we were meeting in some such cases with our grandest success. And so the sum and substance of the whole matter is that we have every encouragement to work on more energetically than ever.</p>
<p>–The following report is from High Bridge lodge, No. 296, of Motts Corners. We had a good attendance and a splendid meeting, full of interest and pleasure. Every member seemed to be in a humorous mood. This spirit appears characteristic of our lodge. Your correspondent has been a member of High Bridge lodge upwards of two years and has never yet witnessed a hasty or angry discussion. Whenever a question meets opposition, it is discussed good humoredly [sic], and in every instance the minority submits with good grace to the majority. To my mind, harmony is one of the great essentials to the success of a lodge. I think I have read that Napoleon, or some other equally distinguished military being, after inspecting his army just before a battle said “we are in accord.” This seems to apply to us; we are in accord with each other and the cause of temperance. But to return to my subject of Lodge items. Dr. Besemer’s string band was fully reorganized and gave the lodge a rare musical treat. Miss Mills, Messrs. Besemer, Merrill, Graham, and McWhorter furnished entertainment for the good of the order. It is hoped our members will all be present at our meeting, as the appointments are good and a good time may be expected.</p>
<p>–All those expecting to attend Grand Lodge are requested to immediately inform Bro. I. C. Andrews, of Ithaca, of the fact. They will also find it necessary to purchase their tickets at the ticket office of the Ithaca depot of the U. I. &amp; E. R. R. in order to secure the reduced the rates. [sic]</p>

<p>GOOD TEMPLAR MATTERS.</p>
<p>–One initiation last Wednesday night at Ithaca Union.</p>
<p>–The Sons of Temperance in North America number about 90,000; the Temple of Honor, 20,000; while our Order, which extends to every civilized and semi-civilized quarter of the globe, numbers about 300,000.</p>
<p>–Good Templarism in Cayuga County is about as low as it can be. There were at one time Thirty-three lodges in that county, but they have fallen off till only three remain. But the prospect is that the work is about to revive in that district. W. W. Gunnison, Grand Lodge lecturer, strikes that county this month, and, if he meets with his usual success, there will be some good work done in old Cayuga directly. To those acquainted with the history of the Order there and its working for the past few years, there is another illustration of the fact if Good Templars lodges are used for any other purpose than that of advancing the cause of temperance, or are turned to promote selfish ends, they will miserably fail. We are glad that the Good Templars of Tompkins county understand so well the objects for which we are banded together. Let us never forget the results we are laboring for and each time that success perches on our banners, move forward with greater zeal to crown the foe to the wall.</p>
<p>–Onondaga county has 22 lodges, with a membership of 1,625, and increase in three months of 165. That completely settles the “hash” for Tompkins County since our gain in membership last quarter was only forty. How much of a gain are we going to report next November?</p>
<p>–The following communication from Progress, No. 93, of Freeville, is gladly received. It is the first we have had from that lodge but we hope no the last:</p>
<p>Freeville, Sept. 2, ‘79</p>
<p>Progress Lodge, although numbering only forty members, is still working harmoniously and adding to its membership. At our last installation we made choice of Wm. Glazier for W.C.T., and we believe that office as well as all the others in our lodge are held by the best of the officers. At this season of the year our attendance is not fully up to the average, but now as harvest and threshing are nearly over we shall expect all to come out. I am sorry to say that we have some members who get led away by associates that think it is a good joke to lead a Good Templar to violate their solemn pledge. Such members we attend to and if we cannot keep them within bounds we give them what is called the “grand bounce.” We don’t want such, but we will try in every way, and a number of times, if there is any hope, to keep them with us.</p>
<p>We have noticed communications from neighboring lodges published in the Ithacan and Journal but have seen none from our lodge. We don’t see why, as we have members that are competent and have been urged to assist you in the good work. Perhaps we may induce our Secretary to lend a helping hand.</p>
<p>–The correspondent from High Bridge Lodge sends in a long communication which we will be glad to publish next week. It is crowded out this week by other matter which came in ahead. We glean a few facts from it. He says: Our lodge was never in better condition than at the present time. During the present quarter we have had four initiations and expect to report many more before its close. Dr. Besemer, assisted by other members of the band gave us some excellent music. Miss Mills, Miss Keeler, Mr. Ludwig and Mr. Miller read selections; and Bro. Lounsbery gave us an interesting account of his trip and stay at Grand Lodge.</p>
<p>–From Crystal Fountain in Slaterville we hear as follows:</p>
<p>Our last two sessions have been of unusual interest, for, although we admitted no new members, we made the most our time when we came to “Good of the Order.” At our last meeting, one of our older members, Bro. Slater, gave us a brief history of the temperance work in this vicinity from his earliest recollection, Sister Dora Wilson, of Ithaca Union Lodge, favored us with music, the remainder of the time being occupied in interesting remarks and selections. Bro. Lewis Schuster, of Ithaca Union, and Bro. Luding, of High Bridge Lodge, made very interesting remarks. Bro. Schuster also recited a poem. We also had a selection read and had any number of short speeches, making it a very interesting session.</p>

<p>–There are in New York State 446 lodges of Good Templars. Of this number 109 were initiated last year and of those 109 thirty were instituted by Bro. Gunnison. Our membership, last May was 22,222. Of this number, 11,509 were initiated last year.</p>
<p>–At the last session of the Grand Lodge there were represented English, German and Swedish lodges, together with negro and India, and yet some say that Good Templarism doesn’t reach all classes.</p>
<p>–The Grand Lodge of Missouri is the leading grand lodge as far as the number of new lodges for the past year counts, having instituted 160 since their last grand lodge. Eighty-seven counties of the state have lodges in working order.</p>
<p>–The clause in the new Massachusetts liquor law requiring every liquor dealer to get the written consent of the owner of the premises is a source of great trouble in the trade, because many real estate owners, while willing to take the money of such tenants, refuse to commit themselves on paper. Some of the most prosperous places in Boston are closed.</p>
<p>–The Ward Lodge of New South Wales at its sixth annual session reported the increase in lodges during the year as 100 per cent and of membership over 200 per cent. At the sixth session of the Grand Lodge of Tasmania (Australasia) reported 2,231 members. The seventh annual session of the Grand lodge of Victoria (Australasia) reported 121 working lodges and a membership of 5,697. That grand lodges has also under its jurisdiction 22 juvenile temples with 1,084 members, and that is what they are doing on the other side of the world.</p>
<p>–Progress lodge, No. 93, of Freeville, has at length, we are glad to hear, elected a regular correspondent, and we hope to hear from them oftener hereafter. A few weeks ago, they had an entertainment given by N. R. Streeter and family, assisted by Miss Nina Halsey, and Dana Rhodes. Next Friday evening, Sept 26, they are to give another of these popular and enjoyable musical feasts at the Lyceum Hall, Freeville. They invite all to attend, especially the members of neighboring lodges.</p>
<p>–Our correspondent from High Bridge Lodge, of Mott’s Corners, sends us the following account of their meeting one week ago Friday night:</p>
<p>Another initiation to-night. Much praise is due to the young members of our lodge in inducing their young friends to join our order and I can assure them that their efforts are much appreciated. I have taken some pains to get an expression of the older members and I find they do not look upon the younger ones as merely paying members but <em>live</em> workers and a material means of success to our lodge. May they continue the good work. Our selections and music were good and [unclear], allow me on behalf of our lodge to express thanks to the large number of visiting members from Slaterville and Caroline Centre for their presence at our last meeting, and extend a hearty invitation to come again and bring their friends. We also extend the invitation to all other members of our Order. Our latch string is always out to our friends and it shall be our endeavor to make it interesting for them.</p>
<p>–G.W.S. Hooker and the following in the Good Templar Gem which may be meant for some of our lodges: “All lodges whose night of meeting is wrongly reported in last year’s Journal of Proceedings, or who have changed to some other evening since then, will please report the change to the G.W.S. at once, whether before reported or not, that it may appear correct in the Journal of 1879.”</p>
<p>–Two initiations at Ithaca Union last Wednesday evening. Ithaca Union challenges any lodge, or any two lodges in the county to report more initiations at the next county lodge, for the present quarter than she does. She has invited nine so far and expects more next week. Last quarter she initiated 21 and intends to do better for these three months than that. If the lodges around the county expect to give Ithaca Union a hard thing to do in coming in ahead this quarter, they will have to wake up pretty soon. Last quarter, Crystal Fountain, of Slaterville, initiated 20. We have not heard even a whimper from that lodge this quarter. Will some one tell us whether or not Crystal Fountain has suspended? Last quarter Speedsville did a good work and reported a number of initiations. What are you doing at Speedsville now-a-days?</p>
<p>–Last quarter, Diligent, of Peruville, Faithful, of North Lansing, Charity, of West Dryden, Joy, of Dryden, Purity, of Etna all reported a number of initiations. But that was for last quarter; what are you doing this quarter? Come! enough of dilly dally! Rally all among the line and tell us what you are doing! If you have done nothing, then, out of shame for that nothing, if for no higher reason, go to work and accomplish something. It can not be that you are looking back with so much satisfaction on what you did last quarter that you think there is no need of effort now. Because you had your breakfast yesterday morning, it isn’t any reason why you don’t want it again this morning. The time of year has come now when you ought to begin to do hard work in fixing for an earnest and determined fall and winter campaign. Don’t put it off till long in November, but go to work now; else you will lose the best month of the year. If it wasn’t slang, we would say “brace up” for hard work, but it <em>is</em> slang and so we only say do your best for the next two months.</p>

<p>–We find in one of the Auburn papers the following account of Bro. Gunnison’s work in Cayuga county up to last week:</p>
<p>Good Templarism once more “booms” in this county. Since W. W. Gunnison began his labors in the county, nearly 100 members have been added to the order. Wednesday evening Mr. Gunnison reorganized the lodge at Levanna, to which several new members were added; and last evening at Union Springs, Mr. Gunison instituted a new lodge to be know as “Wide Awake” lodge with forty-four applications for a charter, of whom forty-two were initiated last evening–twenty-four sisters and eighteen brothers.</p>
<p>–There was one initiation at Ithaca Union last week. At this meeting it was decided to hold an open session one week from this present Wednesday night and to continue to hold them monthly during the winter, the second Wednesday evening of each month being set apart for that purpose. Let the members throughout the county come and see us on any of these night and we will try to entertain them. We will try to do that any time they may come, but will be well prepared for them on these special occasions.</p>
<p>–The following is from High Bridge lodge: Judging from the good templar items in our county papers, one would naturally infer that there were but two or three lodges in the county.</p>
<p>We are sorry to see this. Our county papers have generously given good templarism a place in their columns, and we in this way get much valuable information and encouragement. But, at the same time, we do not get what we might and would get, if all the lodges in the county would report promptly and oftener. Too much praise cannot be given to the county press for what it is doing; and let us improve the opportunity by doing our part.</p>
<p>Our meeting two weeks ago was nearly or quite up to my idea of a lodge meeting. We had two initiations, the initiatory ceremony being performed with dignity and impressiveness. After the regular order of business, we opened under the head of the good of the order and invited a few outsiders to seats in our lodge. We had a number of recitations, songs, and instrumental pieces; also selections which were much enjoyed. One of the outsiders said it was one of the finest gatherings it had ever been his good fortune to attend and it was a wonder in his mind that the entire community were not members of our lodge. So you see I am not alone in my selfish praise of High Bridge. Like all earthly mortals, I am inclined to be selfish and perhaps put too high an estimate on our lodge. No doubt there are many lodges in this county far superior to ours; but if so they selfishly withhold from us their superior mode of conducting a lodge meeting.</p>
<p>–The following is the report of the meeting of Temperance Star lodge of two weeks ago:</p>
<p>Temperance Star Lodge No. 384 met in their room as usual last Saturday evening and after being called to order by W.C.T., G.S. Higgins at the usual hour, they enjoyed a very pleasant session. After going through with the regular order of business they held an open session and after listening to some very choice selections spoken by Sister Lottie Preston and Sister Susie Evans they had a charade which was played by Bro. H. D. Haskins and other prominent members of our order. The charade proved very interesting and was highly appreciated by all. There was more than a usual attendance present, and also quite a large delegation from High Bridge Lodge, and taking all things into consideration I think I can say that it was one of the most profitable and interesting meetings we have had yet this quarter, and one that we could go home from and feel in our own hearts a more full determination than ever to exemplify by our lives outside of the lodge room what we learn there of Faith, Hope and Charity.</p>

<p>The twenty-sixth quarterly session of Tompinks [sic] County Lodge, No. 46, I.O. of G. T. was held Tuesday and Wednesday, Nov. 25 and 26 with Speedsville Lodge No. 353, of Speedsville. The situation of the place of meeting being so far removed from the centre of the county not so many of the lodges were represented as usual. But this fact did not prevent the session from being one of the most interesting and important that has been held for a long time. This was in part because the people of Speedsville have lately been much stirred up in regard to Good Templarism and they gave those who came a most hearty welcome. The great cause of the interest and importance of the meeting, however, was owing to the fact that the delegates from the different lodges were all fully in earnest in regard to the great question for the discussion of which they had met. The attendance was good through the two days. The morning session was opened short after 11 o’clock by C.J.T. R. G. H. Speed. From that time, until the close of the session, Wednesday afternoon, the interest continued unabated. There were eight lodges and one temple represented by delegates during either the whole or a part of the meeting. Some of the lodges report a slight falling off in membership since last quarter, while others again reported a large gain. Progress reported a loss of 7; Crystal Fountain of 5; Diligent reported a gain of 1: High Bridge of 7; Ithaca Union of 8; Speedsville of 25; while Ivy, though reported a numerical gain of only 1, as shown by the books stated that really their gain was much greater. This much from the lodges reported makes a very good showing indeed; what the other lodges, throughout the county will do in adding to or detracting from this report remains
yet to be seen.</p>
<p>The greater part of the afternoon session was taken up with discussing the question laid down upon the programme. “How can we the most effectually accomplish the building up of our order in this county?” There was much to be said, many plans to be proposed, and much deliberation necessary in order to determine exactly what was the best method of proceeding. Among other things it was at length determined to secure the assistance of a suitable lecturer, the executive committee being authorized to use the funds now in the treasury for that purpose. This was only one of several things that was determined upon. Of the others we will speak farther on.</p>
<p>Through a slight misunderstanding in the matter of arrangements, there come near being no speaker for the evening session. However a way out of the difficulty was opened by the prompt manner in which the Rev. Geo. Brown, of Mott&rsquo;s Corners, responded to the call for his services. He most admirably filled the threatened gap with one of his excellent lectures that always hit the mark at which they are aimed. Moreover, bros. Benjamin and Franklin were present unexpectedly to themselves and every one else, and had no small part in making the public meeting the success it was. During the second day the following resolutions were passed:</p>
<p>Resolved, that the County Secretary invite all the temperance organizations of this county to meet (by means of representatives whom they shall appoint) with the executive committee of this body, for the purpose of effecting a county organization that shall have for its subject the securing of a concerted action in the work of redeeming all the towns of this county from the evils of the license system.</p>
<p>Resolved: That this County Lodge appoint a committee of one from each town in this county, such persons to be chairman of a committee to be chosen from the different lodges in each town; the united committee thus appointed to be county committee for the purpose of enforcing the excise law in each town, their sole and only duty being to suppress all illegal traffic in the liquor business.</p>
<p>On motion brother Epenetus Howe was made chairman of the town of Caroline, and the appointigg [sic] of the others left with C.C.T. R. G. H. Speed.</p>
<p>Resolutions of thanks to Bro’s. Brown, Benjamin, and Franklin for their services at the open session were adopted, and also a vote of thanks tendered Speedsville Lodge for the royal entertainment afforded all those who were present.</p>
<p>During the session it was agreed that the home talent we possessed in this county should be more effectively employed than hitherto in preparing the way for a lecturer and in assisting one after he came here.</p>
<p>Therefore, Epenetus Howe, of Speedsville, agreed to go with a good body of assistants to Slaterville, Tuesday evening, December 2, to speak on the temperance question; and to Ithaca at a date to be hereafter decided upon. The above is but the merest skeleton of a report of the session. We have endeavored to condense the matter all that we could, and yet, after having left out so much that was of importance, we have trespassed upon the space and patience of the newspapers that have so kindly lent us their columns.</p>
<p>However good, however important, other meetings of the county lodge may have been, this last one certainly takes the front rank. If during the next two months, a work hitherto unparalleled 1n the history of the temperance cause in this county is not done, these signs must go for naught. Brothers and sisters, let us start the movement now, this present week in our own lodges. The interest of the session was greatly added to by the presence of members from Tioga county; also by the fine singing of Brothers McWhorter and Landon of High Bridge lodge.</p>
<p>The place of holding the next session yet to be determined upon. Those lodges desiring to have the next session held with them will notify the programme committee or County Secretary, as soon as possible.</p>
<p>County Secretary.</p>

<p>—The present quarter is about half gone; how much temperance work have you done during the past six weeks or how much has your lodge done? A thoughtful answer to the above question may do us all
good. Let us go to work in downright earnestness again and see how much we can accomplish in six weeks. We ought to be ashamed to confess that we did not last quarter, as a county, do as well as we did in the summer months when every body was busy.</p>
<p>—Speedville lodge has not stopped with the good work they commenced last quarter. They at that time doubled their membership and by the start which they had obtained two weeks ago seemed in a fair way to repeat the doubling again this quarter. They had then initiated eleven new members and had as many more applicants for admission. Of course we will not find fault with any of the work that the people of Speedville are doing. We only wish them “God Speed” in their hearty endeavors after success. We would say however to the other lodges of the county, “Go thou and do likewise.”</p>
<p>The following communication is from Temperance Star Lodge, No. 384 of Caroline Centre: Although it hag been some time since our lodge has been represented in the Good Templars’ column, nevertheless our zeal for the cause is growing stronger and we feel as though we were accomplishing a good work. We have had nine initiations so far this quarter. But we do not wish to be understood that we boast of the increase of our numbers only but of the interest. But we wish it to be understood that we take pride not only in this increase of membership but also in the increase of interest manifested by all our members, old and new alike. In our last meetings we have had some excellent work done under the “Good of the Order;” fine speaking, the reading of choice selections and good music together with a large attendance has made the sessions exceedingly interesting. Last week we had a play entitled the “Rough Diamond,” which gave all who listened to its rendition great pleasure.</p>
<p>—The regular monthly session of Ithaca Union Lodge occurs this week at their rooms in “Temperance Hall.” On Tuesday evening, Dec 23, they will hold a public meeting in some one of the places of public gathering in this town, the place has not yet been decided upon. At this meeting 1t is expected that not only those from Speedsville who promised to come will be present, but also many from other adjoining places will also see fit to come. We promise to make it interesting for all the brethren who will attend and of course for the sisters. Another matter in regard to Ithaca Union Lodge may be well to mention here, It is very likely that after this week the night of meeting will be Tuesday instead of Wednesday as at present.</p>
<p>However due notice will be given of this fact as soon as it becomes a by-law.</p>
<p>Slaterville sends greeting as follows:</p>
<p>Crystal Fountain Lodge is doing nicely. Last Saturday night the Juvenile Temple held a meeting in the place of our lodge meeting and admitted the good templars. It being a very stormy evening but few good templars were present, but the juveniles were out in full force and did splendidly. John R. Clark is to speak Friday evening on “Intemperance” and Saturday evening on “To and Fro in London”. An interesting time is expected.</p>
<p>—At_a meeting of High Bridge lodge No. 296 the following resolution was unanimously adopted by the lodge</p>
<p>Whereas It has pleased God to lay his hand in heavy affliction upon our brother Wesley Dorn in the death of his beloved wife, our sister, in the morning of life just at the period to our finite wisdom she seemed most needed. Therefore be it</p>
<p>Resolved, that in the death of sister Dorn this lodge also 1s deeply bereaved in losing one of its faithful members and workers.</p>
<p>Resolved, That while we deeply feel our loss as a lodge and as individuals our most heartfelt sympathies are extended to Bro. Dorn.</p>
<p>Resolved, That with him we rejoice in the hope that our loss is her eternal gain,</p>
<p>Resolved, That on one page of the book of minutes be inscribed these words: To the memory of Sarah Dorn, wife of Wesley Dorn, initiated into High Bridge Lodge, May 11, 1877; died Nov. 24, 1879.</p>
<p>Resolved, That a copy of these resolutions be copied on the minutes of this meeting, a copy be presented to Bro. Dorn and a copy be sent to the County Secretary for publication.</p>

<p>—The report has just reached us from Fidelity Lodge, No. 86, of McLean for last quarter, and is encouraging. They had four initiations last quarter, no suspensions, no deaths, and one withdrawal leaving a net gain of three. The lodge 1s certainly proving true to its name. Fidelity forever!</p>
<p>—Onondaga county has just been divided into districts by the Good Templars for the purpose of enabling them to hold union meetings once a month. They have made five districts in the county. The step seems to us to be a good one and worthy of imitation whenever practicable.</p>
<p>&ndash; The regular weekly communication from High Bridge Lodge is given below:</p>
<p>Mott’s Corners, Dec. 20.</p>
<p>“Oh! brudder you’s ought to have been dar!” We mean that we had a good meeting last Friday evening at High Bridge. This is nothing unusual because we have good meetings every week. But last Friday evening was one of those times we can look back to with especial pleasure for a long while, and in the future meetings will be considered good, bad, or indifferent in proportion as they approach to the standard set up last week. And what was the cause of all this? Why the members of Temperance Star Lodge of Caroline Centre were present and ave us under the “Good of the Order” a short play entitled the “Rough Diamond.” The acting was good. Where all did so well it seems to be impossible to set forth the particular ones who excelled; yet we must needs mention Jay Clark, R. C. Clark and Brother Haskins who acted their parts especially well. Besides this we had recitations by Sister Evans and Bro. Jenks. Our own members also furnished songs and recitations and Dr. Besemer’s orchestra favored us with several selections. We like these meetings where we as members of one Lodge can assist our sister Lodges and be assisted in turn, The friends from Caroline Centre claimed to be indebted to us because we had been there at different times and helped them—at least they say we helped them—and desiring to show their indebtedness, they volunteered to come and give us this play. They may now, however, rest assured that they have paid off all old scores and more too, and we would like to get them indebted to us again. At our next meeting we discuss the question of “Home Amusements.”</p>
<p>—Last Tuesday evening Ithaca Union Lodge held a public meeting at its rooms., The meeting was ad dressed by Bro&rsquo;s. Legg, Smith, Howe and Jenks of Speedsville. To say that they all spoke eloquently and to the point would be to say what outsiders felt who listened to them. But it would not convey any conception of the good that they did us as a lodge, We wanted just the help that we received at that time. They reached for us a class that we had labored for in vain before they came. But now we have broken the ice and we hope to receive goodly additions from that quarter, and by the added influence thus gained, to be infinitely more useful than ever before. The brethren from Speedsville may rest assured that they have laid up for themselves, among the good templars here, an unlimited stock of thanks, upon which they may draw at any time and always get the full value of their draft. We hope some time to be able to prove by our actions that our words are not idle.</p>
<p>Such news as the following is very encouraging:</p>
<p>Caroline Center, Dec. 29.</p>
<p>Temperance Star Lodge is still “booming.” Last Saturday evening’s session wad one of the most profitable and enjoyable sessions that we ever held.</p>
<p>Three candidates were initiated, namely: Mrs. F. A. Snow, Mrs. G. S. Higgins and Miss Gertrude Ward. There were also several propositions for membership. Owing to the liberality of some of our members in furnishing refreshments in the shape of nuts, fruit &amp;c. intermission was unusually well enjoyed.</p>
<p>For the “good of the order” we were favored with short speeches from several of our members.</p>
<p>In our the opinion Temperance Star Lodge never was a more prosperous condition than at the present time. Thus far during this quarter we have initiated fifteen, “and still there are more to follow.” Still, we flatter ourselves that we could have held our own, had we not had a single initiation this winter. For, as our report for last quarter shows, we had 53 members in good standing; and moreover a very large majority of these were not only <em>regular</em> attendants but <em>active</em> members as well.</p>
<p>Our treasury also, was in a flourishing state, there being in it a surplus of some $13 or $14 at the end of last quarter.</p>
<p>In giving you these facts, we have had no other object than to assure those of our friends who suppose that the late ‘influx’ of members was all that saved our lodge from dying a natural death, that there was no cause for fear. It seems to us that a lodge having an average attendance of 35 or 40—that even dreams of giving up “the ship” is not worthy of the name of a permanent organization</p>
<p>— Crystal Fountain Lodge of Slaterville has another <em>tidbit</em> for us this week as follows:</p>
<p>Miss Elma Davis read an appropriate and interesting selection before Crystal Fountain Lodge, last Saturday evening. A good deal of time was taken in making arrangements for our “Annual Supper” which was postponed till Tuesday evening Dec. 30th, and will be held at the residence of Dr. W. C. Gallagher.</p>

<p>–Gunnison has commenced his work in earnest in this county. This (Tuesday) evening and to-morrow, he will spend at West Danby. From there he goes to Danby for one evening and then strikes off into Lansing, going first to Lake Ridge on Friday evening and Saturday at Lansingville. Sunday and Monday evenings he lectures in Ludlowville and Tuesday evening at North Lansing.</p>
<p>–The following letter from Freeville explains itself:</p>
<p>Progress Lodge by unanimous vote at their last meeting extends a hearty invitation to the officers of the County Lodge to hold their next session with them at Freeville. Although the convenience for entertaining them may not be as commodious as is an older village, still our people will be pleased to have you meet with them and will do all they can to make you welcome. Trusting that our invitation will meet their approbation, I am</p>
<p>Fraternally, W. H. Richmond, W.S.</p>
<p>No better place than Freeville could be selected for holding the County Lodge. The session will probably be held early in February as it is desired to have the County Lodge meet just as Brother Gunnison closes his work in the county.</p>
<p>—A communication was received from the correspondent of Crystal Fountain Lodge last week, but it came too late for insertion and would probably be stale by this week. One of the things mentioned was that Crystal Fountain Lodge had started a paper of which Miss Elosia Landon was editor. We have forgotten who was assistant editor. Saturday evening, W. W. Gunnison lectured at Enfield Centre. He found, just before commencing the lecture that there was a Division of the Sons lately re-organized there, and feeling that the place was too small to support two strong organizations, he urged all to turn in and assist the Sons. We believe that his lecture there did much to set the people to thinking more earnestly and that the result will certainly be beneficial to the Division at that place. We wish them every success in their good work. From Enfield he went to Trumansburg, and of his work there he himself will tell us at a later time.</p>
<p>–The County Union Temperance meeting that was held at Temperance Headquarters in this place last Saturday afternoon was adjourned to meet in two weeks at the same place. Will every lodge and temperance organization of whatever kind see to it that they have a good delegation presented at that time.</p>
<p>–The drama which was to have been played at Mott’s Corners this week Wednesday and Thursday evenings has been postponed one week on account of the illness of one o the actors, Mr. W. T. Graham. This drama was to be given for the benefit of High Bridge Lodge and we think many from the neighboring lodges will be present to make up a load and go.</p>
<p>–It is time to begin preparations for election of officers for the new quarter. Put up your best men, and then elect them.</p>
<p>–Ithaca Union Lodge had four initiations last Tuesday evening, and several additional propositions.</p>

Competent critics pronounce it to be much superior to amateur performances in general. The music was furnished by Dr. Besemer’s orchestra and was fully in keeping with the performance on the stage.

<p>There are at present between 1,000 and 1,100 Good Templars in the county. If the various lodges in the county maintain the same spirit–during the present quarter that they manifested last, we can report an addition of 200 or 300 to that number at the next County Lodge. Let us rally to the work!</p>
<p>An attempt will be made on Monday evening, March 1, to organize a lodge among the colored people of Ithaca. From present indications the attempt will prove a successful one.</p>
<p>Ithaca Union Lodge has had eight initiations so far this quarter and about twenty propositions.</p>
<p>Cascadilla Lodge, No. 177, of Ithaca, is getting into good working order. They have had initiations at every meeting since their institution. They meet at Temperance Headquarters on Saturday evenings.</p>
<p>Spring Valley Lodge of Groton has organized a reading room in connection with their lodge. They have the furnishing of their room well under way, and when the work is completed, they will have as pleasant quarters as can be found in the county. In fact, we understand that the lodge room goes ahead of anything in the shape of a Good Templar’s room, in this part of the State. We wish that the lodge would appoint a regular correspondent that we might be kept informed through the Good Templars’ column of their movements.</p>
<p>The various temperance organizations throughout the county will receive a communication in a few days from the secretary of the County Temperance Society. Among other things in this communication will be a request for all the lodges to appoint delegates to meet at Temperance Headquarters in Ithaca, on the first Saturday afternoon in March, at one o’clock. We hope to see a strong delegation present.</p>
<p>On Monday evening the members of the Ithaca Union Lodge celebrated the anniversary of their birthday by having a re-union. Members were present from Slaterville, McLean, and other parts of the county, and a very pleasant evening was spent. Various literary exercises occupied a part of the evening among which were a history of the lodge by Bro. Baldwin, an essay by Sister Jennie Burritt, a declamation by Sister Minnie Christiance, and charades by various members together with music. After these the friends repaired to the dining room, where they performed some wonderful gastronomical feats. After the supper various toasts were given out responded to by Brothers Gallagher and White of Slaterville, and Brothers Holden, Franklin, Scudder and Hyde and Sister Seaman of Ithaca, after which a prophecy was read. A more detailed account of the pleasant affair we are unable to give on account of lack of space.</p>
<p>As already announced through the columns of the county papers, a call for a meeting of the Grand District Convention has been made for the 18th of March at Ithaca, by the Grand District Deputy, Bro. Andrews. Of course a good representation will be present from this county. G.W.C.T. Draper will be present during the session.</p>

OF G.T.</p>
<p>The Good Templars of Tompkins county held their seventh annual meeting at Groton on Thursday and Friday of last week. The weather being cool and pleasant a large number of members were present.</p>
<p>Most of the morning session on Thursday was spent in organizing and getting ready for work; we had time, however, for some stirring speeches by Rev. E. R. Wade, of Malloryville and Epenetus Howe of Speedsville.</p>
<p>On assembling in the afternoon reports were received from the different lodges in the county. With one or two exceptions these reports were very encouraging indeed. Nearly three hundred members have been added to the order during the last three months. Spring Valley Lodge of Groton leads the list in point of increase in membership, having initiated sixty-six during the quarter; Crystal Wave Lodge of Trumansburg comes next with forty-three initiations; Fidelity Lodge of McLean reported thirty-two new members and Ithaca Union Lodge thirty.</p>
<p>After the reports had been given the following officers were elected for the next year: C. C. T., I. P. Smith, Ithaca; C.V.T., Mrs. W. H. Allen, Groton; C. Sec., F. P. Rundell, Ithaca; C.C., Rev. E. R. Wade, Malloryville: C.F.S., James MeLachlan, Jr., Groton; C.T., Frank Tarbell, North Lansing; C.M., Rich Morgan, Peruville; C.G., Miss Anna Thomas, Ithaca; C. Sent., Lauren Stone, McLean; C.D., Epenetus Howe, Spneedsville; C.R.H.S., Miss Elosia Landon, Slatarville. C.L H.S., Miss Hattie George, Freeville. C.A. Sec, Miss Emma A. Watson, McLean: C.D.M., Miss Lill Rhodes. Representative to Grand Lodge, Edward Lounsberry[sic], Mott&rsquo;s Corners.</p>
<p>After the election of officers a very interesting paper was read by Rev. E. R. Wade on the subject, “Our Duty, and How to Meet It.”</p>
<p>An open session was held in the Congregational Church in the evening. An address of welcome was given by Rev. A. T. Edwards, of Groton, which was responded to by R. G. H. Speed, C.C.T. The paper read by Wade in the afternoon was so interesting that he was persuaded to read it again in the evening. Speeches were made by Epenetus Howe and Geo. V. Benjamin. Mr. Benjamin having just returned from Maine gave some interesting facts concerning that state. He said Good Templarism is flourishing there, the state containing about twenty thousand members of the order. The lodge at Portland contains three hundred members among which are Hon. Neal Dow; an ex-governor of the state; an ex-mayor of the city; and the prominent business and professional men of the town. Good Templars exert a great influence in shaping the policy of the state. The Maine law is a grand success, the liquor traffic being almost entirely stamped out.</p>
<p>The exercise of the evening were much enlivened by the excellent music furnished by Mr. Landon from Mott&rsquo;s Corners and by the Groton Glee Club.</p>
<p>Quite a portion of the Friday morning session was taken up with the installation of officers and the transaction of other business. Speeches were made by Mr. Stark and Mr. Corby two visitors from Cortland.</p>
<p>The following resolutions were adopted :</p>
<p>Resolved, That our thanks are due the Congregational Church for kindly opening their house for the public meeting of the County Lodge.</p>
<p>Resolved, That Rev. A. Edwards has our hearty thanks for the cordial and eloquent welcome extended us by himself and the people of Groton.</p>
<p>Resolved, That the County Lodge extend their thanks to the people of Groton for their cordial greeting and generous hospitality manifested in welcoming us to their homes.</p>
<p>Resolved, That our thanks are due and are hereby tendered to the Quartette Club, of Groton for their appropriate and timely music furnished at our meetings.</p>
<p>Resolved, That the proceedings of this meeting of the County Lodge be published in the Groton Journal, the Ithaca Journal, the Ithaca Democrat, the Weekly Ithacan, the Trumansburg Sentinel and Dryden Herald.</p>
<p>The afternoon session was spent very pleasantly in listening to speeches and music for the good of the order. The Lodge adjourned at four o’clock and after a general hand-shaking the members separated it being agreed by all that this session of County Lodge was one of the most interesting ever held in the county.</p>
<p>The next meeting of Tompkins County Lodge will be held at Trumansburg.</p>
<p>County Secretary.</p>

<p>We have not yet received any communication from any of the above lodges during the present quarter and hence we have very little in the way of local news to report this week. The new county secretary has not yet had sufficient experience as a newspaper writer to enable him to evolve news out of his own consciousness. Therefore if the Good Templars of the county wish to receive news through this column, it will be necessary for them to report to him promptly any facts of interest with which they may be acquainted. We hope the secretaries named above will bear this in mind.</p>
<p>H. P. Barnes, P.R.W.G.S. of Ithaca, is attending the Right Worthy Grand Lodge at New York city this week.</p>
<p>Cascadilla Lodge initiated three new members last Saturday evening. This makes eleven initiations in that lodge during May.</p>
<p>Fifty new lodges have been instituted in Maine since last October making an aggregate at the present time of about three hundred in that state.</p>
<p>Twenty-four new lodges were organized in Missouri during the month of February.</p>
<p>Returns from Wisconsin show that the order is growing rapidly in that state. Fifty-four new lodges have been organized during the last five months and the old lodges show a marked increase in membership.</p>
<p>An amendment to the constitution prohibiting the manufacture and sale of alcoholic liquors in the state has been adopted by the legislature of Iowa.</p>
<p>The great contest of the year, however, is taking place in Kansas. A constitutional amendment which if adopted will establish total prohibition has been submitted to the people and will be voted upon in November. The state is being thoroughly canvassed and organized. The governor predicts that the amendment will be carried by fifty thousand majority.</p>

<p>In the item above, I assume “No. 720” is a misprint, and not evidence that the Brookton Good Templars restarted after a period of inactivity, possibly corresponding to the last known meeting minutes entries in August 1886. Note these two facts: 1) they kept the same name, although admittedly that is a weak argument, but what seems clearer is that 2) as already noted above, by early 1885, the lodge numbers were already well above this: in “The Official Organ of the Independent Order of Good Templars”, the highest is No. 924, Ithaca. Yet in the Quarterly Report presented above, the High Bridge Lodge was still No. 296 in 1886.</p>
<p>At the turning of the 20th century, at least in Caroline, the Good Templars and other temperance organizations appear to lose influence, and those dedicated to temperance seemed to coalesce around the Women’s Christian Temperance Union.</p>

<li>Although impossible to say with certainty, several aspects of this notice suggest to me that it could have been written by Emily.</li>
<li>The text of the poem is the first four lines of &ldquo;Rest&rdquo; by Mary T. Lathrap (commonly cited as Latrhop), a nationally recognized temperance leader in the late 1800&rsquo;s. According to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Torrans_Lathrap">Wikipedia</a>: &ldquo;Mary Torrans Lathrap née, Torrans; (pen name, Lena; April 25, 1838 - January 3, 1895), known as &ldquo;The Daniel Webster of Prohibition&rdquo;, was a 19th-century American poet, preacher, suffragist, and temperance reformer. For 20 years, she was identified with the progressive women of Michigan who had temperance, purity, and prohibition as their watchwords, and the white ribbon as their badge. A licensed preacher for the Methodist Episcopal Church (1871), she served as president of Michigan&rsquo;s Woman&rsquo;s Christian Temperance Union (1882), co-founded the state&rsquo;s suffrage organization (1870), and worked on the amendment campaign (1874). Lathrap died in 1895.&rdquo; Note the parallels to Annis Ford Eastman. This poem has been used often in obituaries since it was penned, either in part or in its entirety, and it was obviously a fitting tribute to Hannah&rsquo;s life.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/98809451/charles-bogardus">Reverend Elder Charles Bogardus</a> (19 Nov 1843 to 12 Oct 1925). In the 1870 census, he is a farmer in Caroline, but he later became a Baptist minister residing in Brookton. &ldquo;For 20 or more years he was pastor of five churches visiting them once each month.&rdquo; (17 Oct 1925, The Ithaca Journal, Ithaca NY, p5.) &ldquo;He was one of the best known clergymen in this section and many couples now residing here, began their married life with his blessing. He was also called upon to officiate at many funerals. He was well-known as Elder Bogardus.&rdquo; (12 Oct 1925, The Ithaca Journal, Ithaca NY, p5.)</li>
<li>Notice that in the 1870 United States Federal Census, both Hannah and then husband Charles Eastman both have checks in the columns labelled &ldquo;Cannot read.&rdquo; and &ldquo;Cannot write.&rdquo;, although presumably this is inaccurate, as Hannah is described as “a great reader”.</li>

<li>It is interesting to note that the Brookton chapter of the W.C.T.U. was organized in 1907, the same year that Jessie Shurter and Emily Mills were baptized and officially joined the membership roll of Brookton Congregational Church. Emily is listed as Superintendent of Literature and Publications. Many of her neighbors are listed beside her: Jessie Shurter (later Jessie Brewer) Mrs. Dr. B. F. Lockwood, Mrs. Daniel Mason and Anna Mulks.</li>
<li>It seems that Anna Mulks is listed as both Mrs. Charles Mulks and Mrs. Anna Mulks?</li>
<li>Sixty five members strikes me as quite a large number of Christian women supporting temperance for such a small area, especially considering there were a number of other chapters very close by, in Danby for example.</li>
