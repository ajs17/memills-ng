<h3><a href=/family-of-edward-hallock-mills/topics/me-mills/>Mills' Store in Brookton NY</a></h3><div class=meta>
<time>Monday 17 Apr 2023</time>
</div><div class=content><p>After moving to Mott&rsquo;s Corners in Mar 1879, Edward restarted his general store on his own, now simply called E. H. Mills. Both Jonas and Emily clerked at E. H. Mills. Emily took over the store after Edward&rsquo;s death and operated it under the name M. E. Mills from 1909 until her death in 1937. Soon thereafter, Jessie Brewer took over the store and ran it under her name for a dozen years, primarily as a notions store with a lending library in the back. In 1961, Charles Vorhis purchased the building and moved the post office there from what is presently known as Brookton&rsquo;s Market. The Mills&rsquo; store structure survives today and is located at 484 Brooktondale Road, better known to current residents as &ldquo;the old postoffice&rdquo;.</p><a href=/family-of-edward-hallock-mills/topics/me-mills/ class=more-link>read more</a>
