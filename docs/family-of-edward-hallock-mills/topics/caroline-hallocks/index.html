<p>Although there is likely no direct connection between the two families, it is interesting to note that there are a number of Hallocks in the Danby and Caroline area coinciding with the Mills&rsquo; time in the area. But obviously, if these Hallocks are related to Edward&rsquo;s mother, it would certainly suggest reasons why Edward chose to move the family to Mott&rsquo;s Corners.</p><p>The most appears to be known about <a href=https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/66471939/william-b-hallock>William B. Hallock</a> (07 Jul 1822 to 29 Mar 1901), a prominent farmer in Danby who is closely associated with Thomas H. Howell, of Howell Brothers general store, also in Danby. Intriguingly, Hallock and Howell would eventually partner on a dry goods store in Willseyville.</p><p>What follows is a sampling of some of the more interesting news items related to William Hallock.</p><figure class=image style=max-width:500px><img src=/family-of-edward-hallock-mills/assets/images/caroline-hallocks/1876-03-02-The-Ithaca-Journal-p4_hu9532f2814b8bb3596e811a9dd6c8d6ae_43594_500x0_resize_box_3.png width=500 height=285 alt><blockquote>Mr. W. B. Hallock, of Danby was in town to-day, driving a magnificent bay team of young horses, probably about six years old. Mr. H. is an expert in horseflesh, as a judge, trainer and fitter, and always has a stock of fine horses at this stables. The team on our streets to-day we understood is for sale.</blockquote><figcaption>

B. Hallock, of Danby. They are a splendid pair of animals and under the skillful hand of their owner, while they are no slow goers by any means, are docile and manageable as kittens.</blockquote><figcaption>

G. Hallock, of Danby, lost a valuable mule. A man, whose name we did not learn, was driving east on State street, a sleigh load of coal, and from the rear of the sleigh a bar of Swede iron, three-quarters of an inch square, and with a beveled end, projected. A son of Mr. Hallock was driving a team of mules at a smart pace behind this sleigh, and when just at the Tioga street crossing, the sleigh ahead came to a stop suddenly, the bar of iron entering the breast of one of the mules to a distance of two feet perhaps, the animal falling dead in its tracks. A large throng is gathered about the body of the animal which is still lying in the street as we go to press.</p></blockquote><figcaption>

B. Hallock, near Danby village, was considerably damaged by fire between eight and nine o’clock this morning. The flames originated from a defective flue and the roof and upper portion of the building were badly burned before the neighbors, who nobly rallied to the aid of Mr. Hallock, could by the use of pails of water quench the fire. Nothing but active, determined effort saved the house from complete destruction. Mr. Hallock is secured against loss by a policy in the Danby Insurance Company.</blockquote><figcaption>

Mr. Hallock assures us that such statement was erroneous, as the fire evidently caught on the outside of the roof near the eaves, and was caused by sparks from the chimney, a brisk fire of light wood having been just kindled. Mr. Hallock also wishes to return most hearty thanks to his neighbors for their prompt and timely assistance, which saved his house and its contents from entire destruction.</blockquote><figcaption>
