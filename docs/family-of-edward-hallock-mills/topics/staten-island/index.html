<p>Edward and Mary Ann began their marriage in Staten Island NY where they lived throughout the 1850&rsquo;s and where each Mills child was born. Here, Edward presumably learned the grocery business from Mary Ann&rsquo;s brother, <a href=https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/199952123/charles-m-pine>Charles Mills Pine</a> (1812 to 08 Oct 1897), who eventually co-owned E. H. Mills & Co. in Corfu. Edward presumably worked in Pine&rsquo;s general store, which was located in West New Brighton, also known as Factoryville, a neighborhood in the Staten Island town of Castleton, and was known as Pine, Hillyer & Co. and then C. M. Pine & Son. The Mills are members of the Reformed Dutch Church of Port Richmond, where Charles Pine was a longtime member of the church consistory.</p><p>It appears that Edward Mills first met Mary Ann and Charles Pine when he moved with his family to <a href=/family-of-edward-hallock-mills/topics/hempstead/>Hempstead</a> in the mid-late 1830&rsquo;s and Edward&rsquo;s move to Staten Island may have coincided with the establishment of Charles Pine&rsquo;s grocery store, incorporated there in 1848. When Edward and Mary Ann married in 1850, Edward is said to be &ldquo;of Factoryville&rdquo;, the Staten Island neighborhood where Charles Pine&rsquo;s store is located.</p><figure class=image style=max-width:500px><img src=/family-of-edward-hallock-mills/assets/images/1851-01-03-Brooklyn-Daily-Eagle_huc08509a5fd9474424d13eb6f45834857_43206_500x0_resize_q75_box.jpg width=500 height=127 alt><blockquote>At Hempstead, L.

<p>
The "Old Town" collection contains record of births that occurred in the Towns of Northfield, Southfield and Westfield for 1847-1865. The births were recorded in libers (not certificates) and are available on microfilm in room 103. The Municipal Archives does not have records for the rest of Richmond County for the period in question.
<p>
</p>I have researched the records available here for the three births and unfortunately found none of them. Despite the law passed in 1847 mandating recordkeeping of vital records in NY State, and subsequent updates to the law, it wasn't until after new legislation in 1919 that the recording of births were enforced. Knowing that, there may not be a NY State birth record.

This description opens the possibility of a different interpretation of which building was the home: as the directory legend below shows, there is an abbreviation for &ldquo;corner&rdquo; which would seem to be more appropriate than &ldquo;near&rdquo; in this case, and the Beers map indicates Bartlett owned the other lots on that block (although those other lots could have been purchased after the Mills left Staten Island, obviously), so perhaps the home the Mills lived in was the building immediately below the highlighted one, number 424 on the Sanborn map, which is also describe as a &ldquo;DWG&rdquo;.

He was unable to do so, however, and a moment later the wagon collided with a telephone pole, throwing the driver, and a boy who was with him, to the sidewalk. Fortunately neither was injured, but the wagon-top was badly shattered. The horse continued its mad career toward Broadway, where it was caught and stopped by Bartlett Brown, Jr., who rushed out of the store when he saw it coming and seized the bit, unheading the danger of such proceeding.

Bartlett Brown started a new grocery store, married a few months after the census was taken, and started a family of his own, as documented in the records of the Reformed Dutch Church and the 1865 census. The Mills moved to Corfu sometime between the Summer of 1862 and the Spring of 1863, during a period in which the Battle of Antietam in Sharpsburg MD was fought just a few hundred miles southwest of Castleton, and just before the draft riots on Staten Island.</p><figure class=image style=max-width:800px><img src=/family-of-edward-hallock-mills/assets/images/staten-island/RDC/rdc-scan_151-p144_hu9f7a243e54dc61a28ade1f1baebb8000_751426_800x0_resize_box_3.png width=800 height=289 alt><blockquote><table>

"Squire John" [Bodine] owned considerable property on the North Shore, among which was the mill, and the pond, and the land east of it, including the old Dongan Manor house, which he subsequently sold to his father, who died in that house in 1835.

Funeral services were held on the 10th of March in St. Mary&rsquo;s R. C. Church, Port Richmond. Reverend Joseph C. Campbell and his assistants officiating in a solemn mass of requiem and the interment was in St. Peter&rsquo;s Cemetery. The bearers were Horatio Judah, Benjamin J. Bodine, Frank McWilliams, William H. Perry, Bernard Mulin, and Thomas McBurney.</p><p>An elegant pillow in choice white flowers, with the words &ldquo;Our Father&rdquo; upon it, in purple immortelles, and several other handsome floral tributes upon the casket and elsewhere, testified to the regard of friends. The music rendered by the organist and choir was of a superb order. The large church was nearly filled with citizens and their families who came to testify their regard for the memory of a man whom everybody had respected.</p><p>Mr. Mersereau came of an ancient French family which left France in consequence of the troubles there in 1685 immediately after the Revocation of the edict of Nantes. They intended to settle in England, but James II, having just ascended the throne, and elements of disturbance being abroad because of his religious views, they continued their way to this country. They had intended to settle in Philadelphia, but were driven to New York by stress of weather. They settled on Staten Island, in the Town of Northfield, where their descendants are found to this day. Judge Paul Mersereau who died in 1856 and who was Member of Assembly from this county in 1834, and for several years subsequently a Judge of the Court of Common Pleas, was the grandfather of Mr. Mersereau. <strong>His father, David Mersereau, with his brother Paul, for a considerable number of years kept a grocery store at West Brighton, and were the predecessors of C. M. Pine. Mr. Mersereau served as clerk with Mr. Pine for six years previous to 1860 and afterward carried on the grocery business for three or four years at Tompkinsville.</strong> He also spent two years seeking his fortune in California.</p><p>On the breaking out of the War of the Rebellion he enlisted in Company I. Capt. O. D. Jewett, 156th Regiment, New York Volunteers, and continued to serve in that connection until discharged from the service at the close of the war. His regiment served in the Department of the Gulf under General Banks and General Canby, and also in the Shenandoah Valley campaign under General Sheridan, and participated in all the occurrences of that remarkable period in our history. The regiment was then sent to garrison Savannah, and remained there and at Athens until the close of the War. It was with General Sherman when Johnston surrendered.</p><p>Mr. Mersereau was at the battles of Winchester, Cedar Creek, and Fisher&rsquo;s Hill in Virginia, and at the capture of Port Hudson, and performed excellent service. He was sometimes detailed for special duty requiring peculiar qualifications, and at all such times manifested superior ability in successfully accomplishing the work entrusted to his care and won the warm encomiums of those who were in command. He attained the rank of Sergeant. A gentleman of intelligence and high character, who was in touch with Mr. Mersereau during the entire war, and who has known him intimately in all the relations of life, said: &ldquo;He was a good soldier, faithful and true under all circumstances, fulfilling cheerfully and ably every requirement, and in whatever situation he was placed the army, or elsewhere, always acquitted himself in a manner worthy of praise.&rdquo;</p><p>During the last twenty-five years Mr. Mersereau was engaged with his brother in the manufacture of doors, sashes, blinds, and other articles pertaining to the erection of houses, in their manufactory at Port Richmond. The trade grew into a large and prosperous business, because of the diligence shown by the partners, and the esteem in which they were held by all who dealt with them.</p><p>Mr. Mersereau had no inclination for public life, but by general desire he served for some years as a trustee of the Village of Port Richmond, in which position he was a most economical and wise administrator of its affairs, and materially contributed toward sustaining the good name which the village authorities then held before the people. In his private life, his conduct was unexceptionable, and he was always intent upon doing something for the blessing of those who were less fortunate than himself. He was exceedingly tender and considerate in his ways, and sought to prevent others from having trouble, even when it was to be taken to make him more comfortable. His last words were evidence of the truth of this statement when he urged his devoted wife &ldquo;to lie down and take a rest&rdquo; saying at the same time, &ldquo;I will turn over and take a nap.&rdquo; As he thus endeavored to get her to secure the needed rest, on the ground that he did not further require her attention, because he would go to sleep, he turned his face, closed his eyes, and died. It is a beautiful thought that his last act on earth was marked by thoughtfulness of the comfort of another.</p><p>Mr. Mersereau was a member of Richmond Post, No. 524, of the Grand Army of the Republic, and the Flag of the Union was displayed at half-mast over the hall at Port Richmond on the occasion of his death. No flag ever gave its folds to the breeze in memory of a braver man, a better citizen, or a more earnest patriot than the man in whose honor it waved.</p><p>The deceased left a widow, one son, and a daughter, who have the warm sympathy of the community in which they dwell.</p></blockquote><figcaption>

In the edict, Henry aimed primarily to promote civil unity. The edict separated civil from religious unity, treated some Protestants for the first time as more than mere schismatics and heretics and opened a path for secularism and tolerance. In offering a general freedom of conscience to individuals, the edict offered many specific concessions to the Protestants, such as amnesty and the reinstatement of their civil rights, including the right to work in any field, even for the state, and to bring grievances directly to the king. It marked the end of the French Wars of Religion, which had afflicted France during the second half of the 16th century. &mldr; In October 1685, Louis XIV, the grandson of Henry IV, renounced the Edict and declared Protestantism illegal with the Edict of Fontainebleau. This act, commonly called the &lsquo;revocation of the Edict of Nantes,&rsquo; had very damaging results for France. While the wars of religion did not re-ignite, intense persecution of Protestants took place. All Protestant ministers were given two weeks to leave the country unless they converted to Catholicism and all other Protestants were prohibited from leaving the country. In spite of the prohibition, the renewed persecution – including many examples of torture – caused as many as 400,000 to flee France at risk of their lives. Most moved to Great Britain, Prussia, the Dutch Republic, Switzerland, South Africa and the new French colonies and the Thirteen Colonies in North America.&rdquo;</li></ul></div></aside></figure><figure>

<p>
Anglicans established the Church of St. Andrew at the head of the Fresh Kills in the early 18th century. A graveyard and church were begun by 1709 and the stone church building completed in 1712, adding a major institutional presence to the growing hamlet of Richmond. The church was granted its charter by Queen Anne in 1713.
</p><p>
In 1770 the original church building was enlarged and a tall, elegant steeple was added. The steeple followed a design published by the English architect James Gibbs. With its location on a hill adding to the effect of the tall steeple, the church became an important monument that was visible from miles away.
</p><p>
During the American Revolution, the church was a center of military activity. Rev. Richard Charlton, who was a rector of St. Andrew’s at the start of the Revolution (until 1777), is remembered as the grandfather of Saint Elizabeth Ann Bayley Seton, who was the first native-born U.S. citizen to be canonized by the Roman Catholic Church; Charlton and Seton family members are among the distinguished early citizens whose graves can be found in the church’s cemetery.
</p><p>
The early church building was severely damaged by fire on March 29, 1867 and again in October 1872. During the periods of rebuilding, services were held in the nearby Reformed Dutch Church.
</p><p>
Today, the Episcopal Church of St. Andrew is an active faith community. The current structure, attributed to builder George Mersereau in 1872, is noted for the English influences in its design. It was designated a New York City landmark in 1967 and was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2000. The adjoining Burch Hall was built in 1924.

A dry-goods jobber is a wholesale buyer and seller, for cash or for approved credit, of all manner of goods, wares, and materials, large and small, coarse and fine, foreign and domestic, which pertain to the clothing, convenience, and garnishing, by night and by day, of men, women, and children: from a button to a blanket; from a calico to a carpet; from stockings to a bead-dress; from an inside handkerchief to a waterproof; from a piece of tape to a thousand bales of shirtings; not forgetting linen, silk, or woollen fabrics, for drapery or upholstery, for bed or table, including hundreds of items which time would fail me to recite. All these the dry-goods jobber provides for his customer, the retailer, who in his turn will dispense them to the consumer.

<blockquote>
A factory having produced a stock of goods from the best designs to be obtained by its agents here and abroad, the next step is to sell at a profit. Twenty-five years ago the mill or factory sold all its goods to the jobbers, who in turn distributed them to the retailers throughout the country. Each mill had its selling agents who undertook to dispose of its product to the jobbers. A retailer could buy nothing directly from the agent of the mill. Within the last ten or fifteen years the small jobber has been eliminated. In 1850 there were half a hundred dry-goods jobbers in New York City and as many in Boston all doing a good business. Today the number has dwindled to half a dozen in each city. The same thing is true of Philadelphia and Chicago. Only a few of the very largest jobbing houses have survived. The selling agents of the mills now go direct to the retailer, because the retailers have in many instances become buyers upon a much larger scale than the small jobber of former days. Go into the Boston or New York office of the agent of any important mill, and you will find plenty of samples and clerks, but almost no buyers. The agent now goes to the buyer. The agent of the largest cotton-mill in western Massachusetts told me that he sent his men to every large drygoods shop in Boston every day, and his partner in New York did the same thing there. At certain seasons Boston and New York, twenty-five or thirty years ago, were overrun with the buyers of dry-goods houses from all parts of the country. There were hotels and even newspapers devoted to these buyers and their doings. Much of this business has passed away. To-day the travelling men, “drummers,” of the mills and the few large jobbing houses that have survived, scour the country, taking their samples to the retailer. A few large jobbers, doing an immense business, still survive in all our large centres because they have the machinery for the distribution of goods in channels where it is not worth the while of the agent to enter—small shops in small towns. The small jobber who gave up business when he found the mills selling directly to the retail shops who could buy even more goods at a time than he could, had neither the capital nor the army of travelling men necessary to do business upon this scale. The jobber who could buy five thousand cases of goods at a time, and had the machinery and the means for disposing of it, survives because the mills sell cheapest to the largest buyer, and the jobber who buys on this scale is more important that even the largest retail store. But the small jobber, buying one hundred cases of the same goods, gets no better terms than the big retailer and has therefore no excuse for being. Some of the big department stores now obtain a monopoly of certain patterns or designs by taking the whole output of the mill, thus doing what was formerly in the power of only the greatest of jobbers.

The other two bondsmen are Edward Clark and Robert Moore, Supervisor of Castleton. The assignment was made to protect the bondsmen.</p><p>The firm of C. M. Pine & Son is an old house of West New Brighton, and the father and son are well known. They explain the shortage in this way: Many of the members of the association were in the habit of coming to the store and paying their monthly assessments, instead of making these payments at the regular meetings of the association. When Treasurer Pine was absent from the store, which was frequently the case, the money was paid to his father or to the clerks. Receipts were given, but the collections were not properly entered in the books of the Association. This is claimed by the Pines to be due to mistakes, and not to willful wrongdoing. In this way the accounts of the association got mixed up with the firm&rsquo;s account.</p><p>Ex-Treasurer Pine is about 35 years old, and is a widower. His reputation as a business man has always been good. His bondsmen, it is expected, will make good the amount of the shortage to the association. The latter has been in existence for about twelve years, and has a large membership. At the last meeting of the association, when Treasurer Pine’s shortage was discussed, a resolution was passed providing that hereafter the payment of no moneys on account of assessments would be recognized if paid outside of the building.</p></blockquote><figcaption>

M. Pine & Son had failed. Charles M. Pine, the senior member of the firm, had been engaged in the grocery and general merchandise business in the community for nearly half a century, and was, at one time, reputed to be worth nearly or quite $25,000. It was, therefore, as many said, about the last concern on the North Shore that would have been expected to fail. The news spread rapidly, and everyone began to ask what had caused so unexpected an occurrence. The facts, briefly stated, appear to be these:</p><p>For several years, C. Theodore Pine, the junior member of the firm, was treasurer of the Staten Island Building-Loan and Savings Association. His health failed about two years ago and he lost his eyesight. His brother, Alverade R. Pine, who was a clerk in the store was then elected to the treasurership of the Association, as everybody had implicit confidence in the family. It now comes out that the funds of the Association have been used in the business of the firm in a free and easy manner year after year, unknown and unsuspected by the directors and auditors of the Association, until is is now suddenly discovered that there is a shortage in his account amounting to about $10,000.</p><p>When this became known, C. M. Pine & Son, the former of whom was one of the bondsmen, made an assignment in favor of the other two bondsmen, Edward D. Clark and Robert Moore, with A. R. Pine as a preferred creditor. The later then made an assignment of his claim on the assets of the firm (also turning over a mortgage and his household furniture) and made the Building-Loan Association his preferred creditor. Mark Hartley of New Brighton is the assignee.</p><p>A special meeting of the stockholders of the Association was held, on Wednesday evening, but President Westbrook stated that the auditors were not yet prepared to make a full report, notwithstanding the fact that they have been working on the accounts until late at night ever since the assignment. There were several matters which they had been unable to get at thus far, but they hoped to get them all straightened out before the next regular meeting. O. P. Geoffroy, one of the auditors made a partial statement, which indicated a shortage of $9,056.53 in cash, and a deficiency in vouchers drawn on the treasurer amounting to $1,998.45, making a total of $11,054.98. They expect that a further examination will reduce this sum considerably. Secretary Wheeler stated that it would be necessary for them to call in all the passbooks of parties who appear to be in arrears on his books before the exact shortage could be determined.</p><p>Mr. C[undlear] asked if there was any likelihood of the Association losing anything. Mr. Clark said he did not see how it could lose one cent. Should there be anything lacking after the assignment is settled, the businessmen will have to make it good. He, for one, expected to meet that obligation. Daniel [unclear] declared that the auditors and directors had been deceived by Treasurer Pine, [text unclear] some way to deposit in bank so that he could show a certificate of deposit for the amount the books called for, and then, perhaps, drawn it out the next day after the auditors had examined his account-!</p><p>Mr. Brill—that does not exonerate the auditors and directors of this Association. I joined in good faith and with full confidence in the officers, but if I had known what I do now I would never have put a dollar in here!</p><p>President Westbrook reminded the gentleman that each member of the Association was at fault if the officers were. The trouble had come about as a result of the lax methods under which they had been satisfied to do business. There had been no check on the treasurer, either in depositing or drawing out money. At the annual meeting, however, resolutions had been adopted requiring the treasurer to show the president a certificate of deposit within 24 hours after the money is received, and no money can be drawn out without the signatures of the president and secretary. All moneys must hereafter be paid in at the office of the Association. To make it easier for members to do this, the secretary will sit at the Richmond County Savings Bank (in the same building) on the Saturday evening previous to the regular monthly meeting (the second Friday evening of each month), and the Saturday evening following the monthly meeting. The money taken in at such times will be deposited before leaving the building, as the savings bank is authorized to receive deposits for the Bank of Staten Island.</p><p>W. H. Prall said a report reflecting the clerks in Pine’s store had been published in some of the papers. He thought it very unjust that these young men should be charged, even by insinuation, with appropriating any of the money belonging to [the Association?]. No one present believed such to be the case, for so many incorrect statements about these matters get in the city papers that people make allowance for them. The meeting adjourned till Tuesday evening, Feb. 10th, when the auditors will make a full report.</p></blockquote><figcaption>

Pine, died at her home in West Brighton on Monday, in her 77th year. Funeral services were held at the house on Wednesday. Rev. Dr. Brownlee and Rev. A. H. Demarest officiating, and the interment was in the family plot at the Moravian Cemetery. The exercises at the funeral were of a very interesting character, and it is worthy of notice that the two clergymen in attendance were pastors of the church of which Mrs. Pine had been a consistent member for nearly forty years, and were thus better than any one else able to speak of her religious life during that period. Dr. Brownlee based his address upon the words “There remaineth a rest for the people of God,” and spoke with the point, vigor, and earnestness which have always characterized his public utterances. He paid a feeling tribute to the work of the departed, and particularly referred to her patiences and submission in the midst of the severe sufferings which she was often compelled to undergo. Mr. Demarest followed with appropriate remarks based upon the words “For me to live is Christ, to die is gain.” Dr. Brownlee closed the services with a fervent prayer and benediction. Mrs. Pine was well known to a large circle of Christian and benevolent workers as one of the most active and zealous in the performance of duty. In the Ladies Aid Society of her own church she accomplished much good and was largely instrumental in gathering a large sum of money to be used toward the erection of a new Sunday School building. As one of the Managers for many years of the Old Ladies Home at Stapleton she was also highly esteemed for faithful work for the cause, and loving ministry to the inmates. She will be remembered and missed by many others toward whom she manifested kindly regard, and whose lives she sought to bless.</p></blockquote><figcaption>

Theodore Pine, whose death, at the age of 56 years, took place at his home, on Richmond Terrace, West New Brighton, Tuesday, May 28, was a well-known and highly-respected member of this community, in which most of his life was spent.</p><p>Mr. Pine was born in Hempstead, Long Island, June 20, 1839. When he was 10 years old his parents removed to West Brighton, Staten Island (then known as Factoryville), where his father, Charles M. Pine (who still survives), established himself in the grocery and general merchandise business, the firm of which he was senior member being for many years the leading one in its line on the North Shore.</p><p>Theodore remained at Hempstead, and graduated from the Academy some three years later. For a long time previous to the winding up of the concern, which occurred a few years ago, the subject of this notice was associated with his father, under the firm name of C. M. Pine & Son, and earned for himself an excellent reputation as a sagacious, straight-forward man of business, and an energetic, public-spirited citizen.</p><p>Shortly after the breaking out of the civil ware, Mr. Pine, with a number of Staten Islanders—among them our present Police Commissioner, Maj. Clarence T. Barrett—enlisted in Company I, 156th N. Y. Volunteers and served with his regiment, under command of Majors-General Banks and Canby. When the celebrated Corps d’Afrique was organized, Mr. Pine was offered a commission as lieutenant in a colored regiment, which he accepted, and, after the fall of Port Hudson, he was detailed on the staff of his brigade commander, serving first as Aide and afterward as Brigade Commissary. It was while filling the latter position that he was thrown from his horse, receiving injuries to the spine from which he never fully recovered, and which finally resulted in the total loss of his sight and in the brain trouble which for several years past left him perfectly helpless, and to which he at last succumbed. Since the date of his entire disability, he has been in receipt of a pension from the United States government for the injuries received in its service, and it is a great comfort to Mr. Pine’s many friends to know that during the sad years of his helplessness he was blessed by the loving care of a devoted wife and son, whose faithful, unwearied ministrations attended him to the last moment of life.</p><p>Mr. Pine was a deacon of the Reformed Church, Port Richmond, and for twelve years served as its Treasurer. He enjoyed the warm personal friendship of the late Dr. James Brownlee, who, up to the time of his death, manifested the liveliest interest in the condition of his friend, whose sad affliction evoked his warmest sympathy.</p><p>The funeral services were held in the Reformed Church, Port Richmond, yesterday, Rev. Mr. Demarest officiating, and were largely attended. Among those present were representatives of Richmond Lodge, F. & A. M., and James A. Rice Post, G. A. R., of which the deceased was a member. The interment was in the family plot in the Moravian Cemetery, at New Dorp.</p></blockquote><figcaption>

<blockquote>
KILL VAN KULL—ARTHUR KULL.
<p>The precise meaning of the Dutch word &ldquo;Cull,&rdquo; we are unable to give, though it probably had some reference to the water, as Newark Bay was emphatically called &ldquo;the Cull,&rdquo; and was universally known by that name. The Dutch word &ldquo;Kill&rdquo; meant a small stream or passage of water; therefore, the name Kill Van Kull means the stream or passage from the Cull, or Kull, as it is now spelled. Arthur Kull, or Kill, as it is now sometimes written, is a corruption of the Dutch word &ldquo;achter,&rdquo; after, or behind; therefore, Achter Kull meant behind or beyond the Cull. An attempt has recently been made to change the orthography of the word Van, by substituting the letter O for A, thus, Von, which is neither Dutch nor English, and arises from ignorance of the fact that the Dutch A in this connection has the sound of the English O in the same connection; therefore, to spell the word correctly, it should be written Van, and pronounced Von. We give the above as the explanation of the origin of the Dutch names of these waters. </blockquote></p><figcaption>

Although Calvary Church was organized well after the Mills had left Staten Island, it is interesting to note that it was originally comprised of many members of the Reformed Dutch Church. The Methodist Episcopal Church was attended by Mary Ann&rsquo;s sister and James A. Hillyer.</p><figure class=image style=max-width:500px><img src=/family-of-edward-hallock-mills/assets/images/staten-island/1886-staten-island-directory-p351_huee18bc4402e8c3034a9f27809b931fdc_634512_500x0_resize_q75_box.jpg width=500 height=170 alt><blockquote><p>Presbyterian.</p><p>CALVARY PRESBYTERIAN CHURCH.—Bement and Castleton avs., N.

The Chapel is situated on corner of Bement and Castleton avenues, and was erected previous to the organization of the church, and for the accommodation of the Sunday-school which was started May 14, 1872, and out of which the church really grew.</p><p>Rev. Joseph M. Greene was the first pastor, and continued his labors eight years, when he left to undertake mission work in Mexico. He was succeeded by the present pastor, Rev. Theadore A. Leggett.</p><p>The church has had a steady growth, till now its communicants number 250. The Sunday-school is the largest on Staten Island. It is expected that a substantial church will in the near future be erected on the ground the congregation owns adjoining that which the chapel now occupies.</p><p>TRINITY METHODIST EPISCOPAL CHURCH</p><p>Is at the corner of Bodine street and Shore road. Rev. S. P. Hammond is the present pastor, and the officers are:</p><p>Trustees—<strong>William Snedeker (president)</strong>, <strong>J. A. Hillyer (secretary and treasurer),</strong> E. D. Clark, C. W. Kennedy, A. C. Gibson, William H. Lyons, David Stothers, David Houghwout and <strong>A. C. Hillyer</strong>.</p><p>Stewards—<strong>Wm. Snedeker</strong>, Livingston Kennedy, Noah Sellick, E, Smith, William Bamber, C. E. Surdam, D. Lyons, M.D.</p><p>The church was dedicated January 29, 1853, and improved in 1862. There is a fine clock in the tower of the building. A new parsonage is now being erected, and when completed, Trinity will be one of the finest church properties upon the Island. It now has 280 members, the Sunday-school attendance is 250, and people and pastor are in hearty co-operation.</p></blockquote><figcaption>
