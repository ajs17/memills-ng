The Hempstead settlement on Long Island, which began about 1644 and where the name of George Mills was found on the town records, was called a Yorkshire settlement. When Long Island was captured by the English from the Dutch they found on the west end a Yorkshire settlement called Long Island Yorkshire.</blockquote><figcaption><cite>— 28 Jul 1894, Port Jervis Union, Port Jervis NY, p2, nyshistoricnewspapers.org.</cite></figcaption></figure><p>The following two accounts of George Mills are presented for completeness, but note there are inconsistent points between them:</p><figure class=image style=max-width:800px><img src=/family-of-edward-hallock-mills/assets/images/long-island/documentary-history-of-family-mills-p1_hub2e2a225b0b039a7125e63c55913f6fb_562759_800x0_resize_q75_box.jpg width=800 height=428 alt><blockquote>No. 1:–GEORGE MILLS, the progenitor of this family of Mills in America, was born in 16[??] in a parish in England, the name of which has not been recovered in this essay, and he came over in or before 1631-1632 (in which year his son Samuel Mills was born in this Country…) George Mills appears first in contemporary records, as a resident of the town of Hempstead, Long Island, in 1656, a town which had been settled in 1644 by some thirty or forty families from Stamford, Connecticut.

This area provides an unusual survival of a small agricultural community once common on Long Island. The prosperity of the Mills family is evident from this substantial Greek Revival house built for William Wickham Mills in 1838-40. Designed by New York City architect, Calvin Pollard, the house is one of the few high-style structures of this period on Long Island. The extensive original documentation which remains in a family collection provides an unusually complete picture of the construction of a mid 19th century house.”</div></aside></figure></p><figure class=quote-only><blockquote>In an elegant old home on North Country Road in St. James, visitors can find the impressive art gallery of the Smithtown Township Arts Council. The structure, known as the Mills Pond House, holds the work of talented artists and also represents a piece of Smithtown history.<p>It was Timothy Mills who bought the land from one of our town founder&rsquo;s sons in 1693, according to &ldquo;Colonel Rockwell&rsquo;s Scrap-Book&rdquo; published by the Smithtown Historical Society in 1968. As the sons of Timothy Mills married, houses were built around the pond found on the land.</p><p>In the early 1700s, the area became known as Mills Pond. According to the Smithtown Township Arts Council&rsquo;s website, the area was originally called Cuttscunsuck, which means two small ponds in the Algonquian language.</p><p>The original house that was built by Timothy Mills before 1700 was partially destroyed by a fire, according to &ldquo;Colonel Rockwell&rsquo;s Scrap-book&rdquo;. William Wickham Mills, a descendant of Timothy, restored the damaged part of the house and built a three-story addition in 1838.</p><p>Smithtown historian Bradley Harris said William Wickham Mills was one of the richest men in Suffolk County. He was a farmer and also a prominent landlord owning a large amount of land in Smithtown&rsquo;s Landing area. William Wickham Mills also served as Town Supervisor of Smithtown from 1838 – 1841.</p><p>According to the arts council website, a noted New York City architect by the name of Calvin Pollard designed the Mills Pond House. An example of Grecian design, materials such as English glass, Connecticut stone and Santo Domingo mahogany were used contributing to its elegance.</p><p>Harris said, &ldquo;It was the most magnificent house in Smithtown.&rdquo;</p><p>According to the scrap-book, in 1846 a daughter of William Wickham Mills married into Smithtown&rsquo;s Smith family. When he died in 1865, his grandson Dubois Smith inherited the home and land. It was later passed on to Dubois Smith&rsquo;s two daughters Josephine and Mildred Smith, who donated the house to the Town of Smithtown in 1976.</p><p>Soon after the donation of the home to the town, the Smithtown Township Arts Council has been using the Mills Pond House to exhibit the artwork of regional and national artists. The arts council also holds art classes and special events for residents of all ages.</p><p>Despite modern adaptations such as gallery lighting and handicap access, the structure has remained basically unchanged. Visitors to the home can still find formal porticoes and marble mantelpieces.</p><p>The regal Mills Pond House provides the perfect location to expose Smithtown residents to art and also reminds us of a noted local family and our rich history.</p></blockquote><figcaption><cite>— Rita J.

The Trimming Square name was used between the early 19th Century and 1851, when the name was changed to Washington Square after George Washington. The name of the community was again changed in the 1870s when locals made strides to establish a local U.S. post office. The United States Postal Service would not use the name Washington Square, as they felt that there were too many other places within New York which had Washington in their names. This led to locals again changing the name, and they ultimately chose the name Franklin Square.

Also, in some census records, it does appear that his name is written as Thomas J.

Thomas Mills.</p><p>One of Huntington&rsquo;s oldest and most highly respected residents, J. Thomas Mills, passed away early Thursday morning, at the age of 88 years. He had suffered several strokes of paralysis, and had failed gradually since the last attack, some ten days ago.</p><p>Mr. Mills was not born in Suffolk County, but he was only two weeks and two days old when he first came to old Suffolk. He first saw the light of day at Cherry street, New York City, February 13, 1827. He was the son of Jonas D. Mills and Mary Hallock, a Smithtown woman, and before he was three weeks old, his parents came up to Smithtown on a large sailing vessel, to make their home. When young Mills was 18 years of age his people apprenticed him to Samuel Scudder, in this village, to learn the tailoring trade. The shop was over the Huntington House, where many of the dandies of two generations ago secured the latest cut garments. The young man stayed with Scudder until he was married to Ann Eliza, daughter of Barney Manney, in 1848, when he secured a more lucrative position with Jonas Pearsall at the same business. After some five or six years at the Pearsall shop he gave up the trade and assisted his father-in-law, who had a nice farm at Long Swamp (as it was then called) at farming and team work. In 1871 Mr. Mills took the position as sexton of the Huntington Rural Cemetery, which place he faithfully held until 1905.</p><p>Huntington has changed most wonderfully since the time Mr. Mills plied the needle in the local tailoring shops. Then on the south side of Main street the principal buildings were Shepard&rsquo;s bakery, Hopper&rsquo;s hat store, Scudder&rsquo;s general country store, a shoe shop and the Suffolk Hotel, while a large locust-grove stood on the present site of the Brush block and Central Church property. On the other side of the street the principal structures were the Zophar Oakley store, near the site of the present Stevens block; Jonas Pearsall&rsquo;s tailoring shop, where the Goldstein store is now located; Isaac Adams&rsquo; tinshop, where stands the First National Bank; the Huntington House, kept by Samuel Scudder, now conducted by A. Finnegan, and the residences of George A Scudder and Daniel Sammis.</p><p>Eight children were born to Mr. and Mrs. Mills, of whom four are living. Mrs. Mills passed away in 1880. They are: George, Alonzo, Watts and Clarissa, the widow of Edward Etsell, all of this place.</p><p>The funeral services will be held at the home of his son, George Mills, on Wall street, with whom he lived, Saturday, at 2 o&rsquo;clock, in charge of the Rev. Samuel H. Seem, pastor of the Central Presbyterian Church, of which deceased was a member. The interment will be in the Huntington Rural Cemetery.</p></blockquote><figcaption><p>— <cite>23 Apr 1915, The Long-Islander, Huntington NY, p5, nyhistoricnewspapers.org. </cite><a class=origversion href=/family-of-edward-hallock-mills/assets/images/long-island/1915-04-23-The-Long-Islander-Huntington-NY-p5.png>View largest available size.</a></figcaption><aside><div class=notes><ul></p><li>The Mills&rsquo; arrival in Smithtown, &ldquo;two weeks and two days&rdquo; from James&rsquo; birth on 13 Feb 1827 was 01 Mar, the day before Edward&rsquo;s mother Mary Hallock died, although the exact date of her death is only given by one source that is currently defunct: MillsAncestry.org.

Mrs. Miller [sic] was the wife of an old resident of Hempstead, Robert S. Mills, and the daughter of Richard and Phebe Losea, She was born in East Williston, and was married in 1858. For some years previous to coming to Hempstead village to live, Mr. and Mrs. Mills occupied the Richard Losea homestead, about two miles from the village. This house is nearly one hundred years old, and is still a landmark. Mrs. Mills was a member of the Presbyterian Church and a devoted wife and mother. The golden wedding of Mr. and Mrs. Mills was quietly celebrated three years ago at their Grove street residence, where the funeral services were held.

The family originated in Buffalo, New York and moved to Long Island in the 1800’s. Most of the information included in this collection was organized and collected by James H. Mills through correspondence with fellow family members and work done by B.F. Thompson. The collection contains several logs of Mills Family descendants and related families from other territories in America. There are also letters from Henry/Harry Mills dated from 1871-1874. Henry/Harry Mills seems to have done a lot of research on family history. The bulk of the collection focuses on the descendants of Timothy Mills an early settler of Mills Pond, Long Island.</p><h3>Scope And Content Note</h3><p>The Mills Family of Jamaica and Mills Pond, Long Island (2 boxes, 1675-1900) contains material documenting the genealogy of the Mills Family of Jamaica, Long Island. The collection is made up of letters and logs of Mills Family descendants. Research consists of various logs and lists of family members. There are also letters and listings of Mill Family members from other parts on the United States. This collection was donated to the Buffalo History Museum by Louise Olmsted, whose family were close friends of the Mills Family located in Buffalo. The collection was donated to the Queens Library Archives in August 2015. The original finding aid for this collection is included with this finding aid. A description of each folder’s contents is located within each folder of the collection. The Mills Family (19 folders, 1879-1895) series has been broken down by specific family members. The specific members are: Isaac Mills (5 folders, 1879-1893) Jonas Mills (1 folder, 1893) Jonathan Mills (3 folders, 1879-1895) Timothy Mills (10 folders, 1739-1896) The series for each contains information on various relatives for each member. The information includes spouses and children. The Research series (5 folders, 1675-1876) contains the forms and documents used for accumulating the history of the Mills Family. The other series in the collection Various Relatives (6 folders, 1636-1900) consists of material related to other relatives of the Mills Family that lived outside of the Jamaica and Long Island area.</p></p></blockquote><figcaption><cite>— <a href=https://www.queenslibrary.org/manuscripts/0205#bg-largeview-about>The Mills Family of Jamaica and Mills Pond, Long Island</a>, Archives at Queens Library, Queens Borough Public Library, Jamaica NY.</cite></figcaption></figure><p>Of course, there are several Jonas Mills in the genealogy, but the dates given suggests this could be a reference to Edward&rsquo;s father.

He composed many songs and musical pieces which were published and proved to be popular. Several copies of original editions of these publications are still in possession of members of the family. He is best known however, as the author and composer of the first original American Opera, entitled "The Saw Mill," which had a satisfactory run at Henry Wallack's Chatham Theatre in New York city, during 1824. Besides his musical activities Micah Hawkins kept a grocery store in Catharine St. New York, in which was installed a piano and he was wont to regale his customers with a little music when they visited his shop.</p><p>He was a pleasant conversationalist, possessed a ready vein of wit and withal a good singer. It especially pleased him to sing his own songs which he did with great gusto. His portrait painted by Louis Child and retouched by his nephew William S. Mount, hangs in the Hawkins-Mount house at Stony Brook L. I. where he was born. It is said of him that he always wore a white cravat, which fact is attested by the portrait. Micah Hawkins was a close friend of Benjamin F. Thompson, the historian, who did much to encourage him in his musical efforts. For a further account of this interesting individual see Oscar Wegelin's "Micah Hawkins and The Saw Mill."</p><p>Of the printed edition of the "Saw Mill" only two copies are know to be in existence today, one belonging to Brown University and the other in the hands of a private collector. The book is therefore much sought after by collectors of Americana, particularly those interested in early drama.</p></blockquote><figcaption><cite>— 1919, <em>Genealogies of Long Island families : a collection of genealogies relating to the following Long Island families: Dickerson, Mitchill, Wickham, Carman, Raynor, Rushmore, Satterly, Hawkins, Arthur Smith, Mills, Howard, Lush, Greene</em>, Compiled by Charles J.

S. W. MILLS OF PORT JERVIS.</p><p>An Important Genealogical Document Embodying Much New and Valuable Information—History of the Mills Family in America.</p><p>We publish herewith a portion of the genealogy of the Mills’ family, which was compiled by Rev. Dr. S. W. Mills, of this village and read at the meeting of the M. V. H. S., at Glenette, Saturday, June 21. It embodies much information in regard to that family not hitherto made public. The remainder of the article will appear in tomorrow’s UNION.</p><p>The name of Mills, which is found in so many parts of our country, appears to be chiefly of English origin. There are those who bear the name who are of Holland extraction. In the early settlement of New England there was one Peter Water Van der Mulin, who emigrated from Holland and settled at Windsor, Conn., and took the English name of Mills. (The English of Van der Mulin is from the Mills). This same name is found among the earlier settlers of Hartford, Conn. Of his descendants we know nothing, but it is quite probable there are those living who can trace their ancestry back to him.</p><p>Of those of English extraction we know more. The name of Milnes or Mills, otherwise De Molis, was found in Devon, England, in 1083 6. It was derived from Meulles, Normandy. It is supposed to have been brought there in the time of William the Conquerer, who introduced the Norman language into England about 1066. Lord Haughton (Milne) has been a member of Gladstone’s Cabinet in this year, 1894. Under the various forms of Mill, Mills, Milne, Milles and Mylles, the naine is found in Yorkshire in 1530, 1560, 1584, 1612, 1627 and 1665. In Sussex county. England, it appears as follows: Geffry &lsquo;Atte Milne 1307-27; Agnes &lsquo;Atte Milne’, John ’Atte Mull’ alias Mill, Lord of Gretham 1366 ; Robert ‘Atte Mulle’ alias Mills of Gilford, Surry county, 1377-1399 ; John ’Atte Mille’ of Pullborough, 1366 ; Robert Mill of Sussex 1422-1461; John Mylle 1578 ; Sir Richard Mill (b) 1690.</p><p>The first emigrant by the name of Mills from England of whom we have knowledge was John Mills, who came over in the fleet with Gov. Winthrop in 1629 or 1630. His name stood No. 33 on the roll of the first church in Boston, where two of his daughters (Joy and Remembrance) were baptised in October, 1630. He was made freeman in Boston, March 6, 1632. He resided there ten years and then removed to Braintree, Mass., where in 1653 he was clerk of Braintree. In his will made June 1670, he expresses the wish that his son John, to whom he gave his estate, &ldquo;would bring up one of his sons to the ministry, as this had been the calling of his predecessors to the third if not the fourth generation.&rdquo;</p><p>There was one Richard Mills who was called the &ldquo;Pioneer Schoolmaster&rdquo; of New York, who lived on Long Island and in Connecticut ; Samuel Mills, who lived at Dedham, Mass., and Samuel Mills, who lived at Windsor, Conn., all of whom came from England at a very early date, but the precise year not known. How they were related and who were their descendants we have not learned.</p><p>George Mills was probably the ancestor of the Long Island Mills. He came from Yorkshire, England, and was born about 1605, and died at Jamaica, L. I., Oct. 17, 1694, aged 89 years, His name is found on the town records of Hempstead and Jamaica in Feb. 16, 1656, and Nov. 25, 1656, when he was granted a home lot in each town. Some have supposed that this George was a brother of John, who came over with Gov. Winthrop, but no proof of the fact has yet been found.</p><p>Samuel, a son of George, was born in this country in 1631, and died at Jamaica in March, 1726, aged 95. A notice of his death appeared in the N. Y. Gazette of March 12, 1726, in which it was stated that he was able to do a good day’s work but a few days before he died. He had 16 children, nine of whom were living at the time of his death, 80 grandchildren and 54 great grandchildren.</p><p>Jonathan Mills, who lived at Jamaica, and whose wife was Martha, was probably the son of George. The date of his birth and death are not known. On March 30. 1677, he bought of Jonas Halstead and his son Joseph, a piece of land owned by them jointly. His wife, Martha, was living in 1710, as well as himself. They had four children, Timothy, Samuel, Isaac and Jonathan, jr. Of these, Timothy was born in 1667, and moved from Jamaica to Mills&rsquo; Pond, four mils from Smithtown, in 1693, the first of the name to locate there, and where he died March 30, 1751. By his first wife, Elizabeth, he had two children, and by his second, Sarah, eleven. Of these eleven the sixth was Jonathon, who was born Oct. 23, 1710, who was the father of Jacob Mills, Windsor, born Dec 22, 1746, and who subsequently settled in the town of New Windsor, Orange county, N. Y.</p><p>Jonathan Mills married April 3, 1737, Ruth. Rudyard, daughter of John Rudyard of Perth Amboy, N. J., by whom he had six children. On January 25, 1756, he married Dorothy Miller, by whom he had three children. He lived at Mills Pond, where he died Oct, 23, 1798, Of the six children by his first wife, Jacob and Timothy were twins.</p><p>The first person by the name of Mills (of the Long Island Mills) who settled in Orange county of whom we have any account, was Timothy, son of Timothy the first settler at Mills Pond, by his second wife, Sarah. He married Margaret Rudyard, daughter of John Rudyard of Perth Amboy, N. J. About 1752 a division of his father’s land on Long Island was made, and he appears to have left Mills Pond and to have settled at New Windsor, which was then in Ulster county. His deed, recorded in Ulster county Deeds (F. F. 465), dated May 20, 1754, states that he is of the precinct of Wallkill, in the county of Ulster. He bought for £370 a tract of 571 acres of land from the Garret Schuyler and Hans Ulrick Bindor heirs, who lived in New York. His will was recorded in New York in 1780, in which he mentions his sons, John, Jonathan and Daniel, and his daughters, Joannah and Anah, and also his wife, Margaret. No trace hag been found of the descendants of this Timothy Mills.</p></blockquote><figcaption><p>— <cite>27 Jul 1894, Port Jervis Union, Port Jervis NY, p3, nyshistoricnewspapers.org. </cite><a class=origversion href=/family-of-edward-hallock-mills/assets/images/long-island/1894-07-27-Port-Jervis-Union-Port-Jervis-NY-p3.png>View largest available size.</a></figcaption><aside><div class=notes><ul></p><li>&ldquo;M.

S. W. MILLS OF PORT JERVIS.</p><p>An Important Genealogical Document Embodying Much New and Valuable Information—History of the Mills Family in America.</p><p>Concluded from yesterday.</p><p>Jacob Mills, who subsequently settled in New Windsor, was a nephew of the Timothy just mentioned. His father was Jonathan Mills of Mills’s Pond by Ruth Rudyard, his first wife. Jacob and his twin brother were born Dec. 22nd, 1746. Timothy married a Miss Miller and settled in Saratoga county, N. Y. His grandson, Thomas H., lived at Ballston, N. Y., in 1880.</p><p>The Mills on Long Island were of English descent and it would seem quite clear that they came from Yorkshire, England, to this country about 1630, locating at first in New England and some of them soon after on Long Island. The Hempstead settlement on Long Island, which began about 1644 and where the name of George Mills was found on the town records, was called a Yorkshire settlement. When Long Island was captured by the English from the Dutch they found on the west end a Yorkshire settlement called Long Island Yorkshire.</p><p>When Jacob Mills grew up to manhood, the British law was in force here and the custom of primogeniture in full operation. In accordance with this custom his older brother fell heir to the landed estate while he was taught the trades of tanning and currying and of shoemaking, which in those days were combined together, especially on Long Island. When he was about nineteen years of age he entered upon a series of whaling voyages, going for this purpose in the spring with other young men to Nantucket and from there embarking for Greenland, as it was called, the only whaling fishery then known. These voyages lasted usually six or seven months, when he would return home and work at his trade in the winter, whipping the cat, as it was called, going from house to house. There were no wages on the vessel, but a certain portion of the cash was allotted to each one according to his position. In this way he accumulated quite a little sum during the three voyages made by him, the last one especially being quite successful.</p><p>At just what time he came to Orange county, is not known, but it was probably between 1768 and 1770, or when from twenty-two to twenty-four years of age. He bought a tract of land four miles back of New Windsor, built himself a house and started a small tannery, conducting at the same time farming, tanning, currying and shoe-making. He lived here as a bachelor for two or three years until his marriage to Catharine Denton, of Goshen, Dec. 27th, 1773. He was not in the army during the Revolution as his trade was required to furnish shoes for the soldiers. He belonged to a militia company and when the British were coming up the Hudson river to attack Fort Montgomery, his company was suddenly ordered out to march the next morning to the defence of the Fort. He marched with the company after having worked all night to make a pair of shoes for one of the men, who was barefoot. The Fort, however, had been taken by the British before his company reached it.</p><p>He furnished, he said, a large number of shoes for the army, but at the close of the war his money was worthless and he had to begin life anew. His place, however, was paid for and he had this advantage.</p><p>A few years after the war, the year is not known, he sold his place in New Windsor and bought 2,250 acres in the town of Wallkill, about five miles north of Middletown and moved his family there, the place having been known for many years of late as Millsburgh. The price paid by him for his large tract of land he has been heard to say was thirteen shillings and six-pence happeny per acre in Continental money. Here he started again a tannery consisting at first of but four vats on which he could tan about two-hundred hides, but which was subsequently greatly enlarged. He at first lived on what was known as the Smith place, half a mile or more south-east of the tannery and east of the direct road leading to Scotchtown. In 1791 he built the stone house near the tannery, employing for this purpose a mason from Little Brittian, all the mortar for which building, was carried by his son Samuel, then but fifteen years of age. This house he then occupied until 1807, when he built the large frame dwelling a little north of it in which he lived with his son Charles and where he died in 1841, in the 95th year of his age.</p><p>The stone house, tannery and farm connected therewith formerly occupied by him, he gave to his sun, Samuel. He was one of the leading persons in the erection of the Presbyteriam church at Scotchtown. Besides contributing liberally in money for this purpose he kept his team there constantly during the time of its erection.</p><p>He had twelve children, six sons and six daughters. Seven of these were probably born in New Windsor. Jacob, jr., was born in Wallkill in 1791, the year in which the stone house was erected. All of these but one, Catharine, were married and had families of their own, All but one, Wm. Wickham, lived and died in Orange county. This one married at Mills Pond, L. I., where he subsequently lived and died.</p><p>The grandchildren of Jacob Mills numbered 97, being evenly divided as to sex, 48 males and 49 females. The males have nearly all been farmers and the females have uniformly married farmers. Of these 97, one has been a physician, one a lawyer and one a clergyman. They have had but little aspiration for office or political distinction. Except a town office like that of roadmaster, but one among them all has held anything higher, he having served one term as Sheriff of the county of Orange.</p><p>In addition to the Mills who settled in New England and on Long Island, referred to in this sketch, there were emigrants by this name (three, it has been said) who, in the early history of the country, settled in Virginia, and their descendants are to be found in the other southern states. Roger Q. Mills, the present U. S. Senator from Texas, (1894) says that his great grandfather, Charles Mills, lived in Hanover Co., Va. He says that he has met a number of persons by this name from the north, but has been unable to trace any relationship to them, but yet is satisfied that several generations back they all came from the same stock.</p></blockquote><figcaption><p>— <cite>28 Jul 1894, Port Jervis Union, Port Jervis NY, p2, nyshistoricnewspapers.org. </cite><a class=origversion href=/family-of-edward-hallock-mills/assets/images/long-island/1894-07-28-Port-Jervis-Union-Port-Jervis-NY-p2.png>View largest available size.</a></figcaption><aside><div class=notes><ul></p><li>Genealogies for the surnames Rudyard and Miller, as well as correspondence with W.

After the tanning process, the currier applies techniques of dressing, finishing and colouring to a tanned hide to make it strong, flexible and waterproof. The leather is stretched and burnished to produce a uniform thickness and suppleness, and dyeing and other chemical finishes give the leather its desired colour. After currying, the leather is then ready to pass to the fashioning trades such as saddlery, bridlery, shoemaking and glovemaking.”</li><li>According to <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halfpenny_(British_pre-decimal_coin)>Wikipedia</a> &ldquo;The British pre-decimal halfpenny (1/2 d) coin, usually simply known as a ha&rsquo;penny (pronounced /ˈheɪpəni/), historically occasionally also as the obol and once abbreviated ‘ob’ (from the Latin ‘obulus’), was a unit of currency that equalled half of a penny or 1/480 of a pound sterling. Originally the halfpenny was minted in copper, but after 1860 it was minted in bronze. In the run-up to decimalisation it ceased to be legal tender from 31 July 1969. … &ldquo;Halfpenny&rdquo; was colloquially written ha’penny, and &ldquo;1+ 1/2 d&rdquo; was spoken as &ldquo;a penny ha’penny&rdquo; /ə ˈpɛni ˈheɪpni/ or three ha’pence /θriː ˈheɪpəns/. Before Decimal Day in 1971 there were 240 pence in one pound sterling. Twelve pence made a shilling, and twenty shillings made a pound. Values less than a pound were usually written in terms of shillings and pence, e.g. 42 pence would be three shillings and sixpence (3/6), pronounced &ldquo;three and six&rdquo;, whereas 3 shillings even would be &ldquo;3s&rdquo; or, on a sign in a shop, &ldquo;3/-&rdquo; (the dash usually being written instead of 0 for pence). Values of less than a shilling were simply written in pence, e.g. eightpence would be 8d (the &ldquo;d&rdquo; standing for the Latin word denarii (sing. denarius, a common coin in Roman Britain).
