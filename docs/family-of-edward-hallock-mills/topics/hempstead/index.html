<p>Edward presumably moved to Hempstead with his family in 1837. There, he met his first wife, Mary Ann Pine, and her brother and Edward&rsquo;s mentor in business, Charles Mills Pine. The Mills and the Pines attended Christ&rsquo;s First Presbyterian Church.</p><p>In 1837, when Edward was approximately 18 years old, the Mills family moved to Hempstead NY, according to Jonas&rsquo; obituary. It appears likely that Edward followed the rest of the family to Hempstead, as it is noted in the Hempstead Sentinel that Edward lived there at one time.</p><figure class=image style=max-width:800px><img src=/family-of-edward-hallock-mills/assets/images/1882-02-10-The-Long-Islander-Huntington-NY-p3_hu64b95de8c1449678c7f58fbec2070f59_63255_800x0_resize_box_3.png width=800 height=829 alt><blockquote><p>—On Monday evening of last week one of the old residents of Hempstead died. Mr. Jonas D. Mills, who was born at Stony Brook, [Suffolk County?], May [unclear day and year], making him at the time of his death, 86 years, 8 months, and 28 days old. In his young days he learned the wheelwright trade, which at that time included the undertaking business. He subsequently took up farming in Queens County, but for the past 30 years he has not been actively engaged in business. He was married twice, and had two daughters and three sons, the latter still living—Edward H., J. Thomas, and Robert S. Mills. He came to this town about 1838, locating at Trimming (now Franklin) Square; in 1837 he came to this village, where he has ever since resided, with the exception of a few years. He always enjoyed good health, never needing a physician, and died of old age.</p><p>—Hempstead Sentinel</p><p>Mr. Mills was the father of J. Thomas Mills of Huntington.</p></blockquote><figcaption>

The hamlet is an unincorporated area in the Town of Hempstead. &mldr;The area was originally known as Trimming Square and then as Washington Square. &mldr;It is rumored that the original name for the area, Trimming Square, reflected the fact that farms once dominated the area&rsquo;s landscape (as was common for areas all across the Hempstead Plains), and because many sheep were brought to the area by local farmers for separation during the latter parts of the 18th Century. The Trimming Square name was used between the early 19th Century and 1851, when the name was changed to Washington Square after George Washington. The name of the community was again changed in the 1870s when locals made strides to establish a local U.S. post office. The United States Postal Service would not use the name Washington Square, as they felt that there were too many other places within New York which had Washington in their names. This led to locals again changing the name, and they ultimately chose the name Franklin Square. It is rumored that the name is in honor of Benjamin Franklin.&rdquo;</li><li><a href=https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/74905990/james-thomas-mills>James Thomas Mills</a> (13 Feb 1827 to 22 Apr 1915) is Edward’s brother, and <a href=https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/29864008/robert-sydney-mills>Robert Sydney Mills</a> (11 Nov 1835 to 15 Jan 1912) is Edward’s half brother.</li></ul></div></aside></figure><div class=cols>

<blockquote>
<p>If Hempstead were to be incorporated as a city, it would be the second-largest city in New York, behind New York City; it is about three times the size of Buffalo, which has long been the state's second-largest city. ...Hempstead is thus the most populous municipality in the New York metropolitan area outside New York City.
</p><p>
...During the American Revolution, the Loyalists in the south and the American sympathizers in the north caused a split in 1784 into "North Hempstead" and "South Hempstead". With the 1898 incorporation of the Borough of Queens as part of the city of New York, and the 1899 split of Queens County to create Nassau County, some southwestern portions of the Town of Hempstead seceded from the town and became part of the Borough of Queens.

</figcaption></figure><p>For Edward to move to Hempstead as a young man fits with other known facts and greatly adds to our understanding not only of his early adulthood, but the rest of his life. In Hempstead, Edward met two very important residents: Mary Ann Pine, who became Edward&rsquo;s first wife and mother of Emily Mills, and Mary Ann&rsquo;s brother, Charles Mills Pine, who became Edward&rsquo;s employer and mentor in the grocery business.</p><p>A few years prior to the Mills&rsquo; move to Hempstead, Charles was already living there, newly married to Elmira Loper whose family also lived in Hempstead and attended Christ&rsquo;s First Presbyterian Church. Charles is presumably the Pine (or perhaps it is his father Nicholas?) of the general store Weekes, Seaman & Pine. Hempstead was presumably when Edward&rsquo;s and Charles&rsquo; paths first crossed, and it would seem likely that Edward may have initially worked at Weekes, Seaman & Pine. To understand Edward&rsquo;s life, one must understand the life of Charles Pine, which Edward emulated in many ways.</p><figure class=image style=max-width:800px><img src=/family-of-edward-hallock-mills/assets/images/staten-island/1835-02-21-charles-pine_hub21a191e9c0d1ffd94725d1b86e50258_1262585_800x0_resize_q75_box.jpg width=800 height=421 alt><blockquote><p>Vol. V, No. 238 - February 21, 1835.</p><p>&mldr; In Hempstead, L.I., Mr. Charles Pine, of the firm of Weeks, Seaman & Pine to Almira Jane, daughter of Luther Loper. &mldr;</p></blockquote><figcaption>

<blockquote>
The history of Christ's First Presbyterian Church is closely identified with the history of Hempstead. In 1643, the Rev. Robert Fordham and John Carman found a suitable location for settlement here and purchased land from the Native Americans. Families came to settle the next year. They received a patent from the Dutch governor of the New Netherlands and the church was organized under Rev. Richard Denton. Rev. Denton had first settled in the Massachusetts May Colony, but left for Weathersfield, Connecticut in 1635 in order to practice Presbyterianism. Later, he and his followers came to Long Island for religious reasons. They established Christ's First Presbyterian Church in 1644. It is one of the oldest Presbyterian Churches in the country.

</figcaption></figure><p>The 1895 Souvenir book shows Robert Mills still listed as an active member (p71).</p><p>I know of no formal histories or genealogies of the Pines, and initial searches starting with Mary Ann resulted in very little, so I have had to reconstruct this branch of the Pine tree from remaining documentary evidence.</p><p>From the beginning of this research, Charles M. Pine emerged as a central figure in the Mills&rsquo; lives, and although I didn&rsquo;t know exactly how at the time, the last name struck me as a very big coincidence, and so I assumed he was related to Mary Ann, and probably quite closely, and that a closer examination of Charles&rsquo; life would reveal much about the Mills. In time, I slowly compiled evidence proving that Mary Ann and Charles M. Pine were siblings. This fact alone explains much about the Mills&rsquo; lives.</p><p>My ability to make this connection was initially hindered by the fact that of the handful of member-created genealogies on ancestry.com that included Charles and referenced his parents, all showed his parents as some variation of:</p><ul>
<li>
<p><a href=https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/58487321/charles-l-pine>Charles L. Pine</a> (1785 to Apr 1853), whose relation to these Pines, if any, is presently unknown to me.</p></li><li>
<p>Sarah Soper (1787 to ?), a person I have otherwise been unable to identify. Her age is listed as 78 in 1865.</p></li></ul><p>(I will add that Charles M. Pines&rsquo; entries on these genealogies were very incomplete, so he was obviously not the focus of these trees.)</p><p>Before moving onto what I believe is overwhelming evidence that Charles M. Pine is Mary Ann&rsquo;s brother, I will try to account for this apparent discrepancy with Charles&rsquo; parents. It appears that the source of this error may be these entries in the 1865 New York State Census:</p><figure class=image style=max-width:800px><img src=/family-of-edward-hallock-mills/assets/images/pine/1865-census-nys_huef7460e2f8981069fa5c1ec857027020_1513775_800x0_resize_q75_box.jpg width=800 height=380 alt><figcaption>

There is a <a href=https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/199166807/julia-e-soper>Julia E. (Oakes) Soper</a> (Nov 1844 to 01 Apr 1910), born in Huntington, who, despite being the correct age, was married to Ezra Soper in 1867, so in the 1865 census she would not have the name Soper.</p><p>I have a theory as to what might be happening, although with some noticeable counterpoints which I will also explore. Taking into account all the evidence I have available, I believe the most logical conclusion is that these two census entries in 1865 are referring to relatives of Charles Pine&rsquo;s wife <a href=https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/199952046/elmira-j-pine>Elmira Jane (Loper) Pine</a> (1813 to 07 Mar 1890). Elmira&rsquo;s parents are:</p><ul>
<li>
<p><a href=https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/178362810/luther-loper>Luther Loper</a> (04 Jun 1780 to 05 Apr 1856), married,</p></li><li>
<p><a href=https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/141069644/sarah-loper>Sarah (Bishop) Loper</a> (1783 to 06 Jan 1870). Although the exact birthdates are unknown for both Sarah Loper and &ldquo;Sarah Soper&rdquo; (above), Sarah Loper&rsquo;s entry on FindAGrave states she died in her 86th year, which would make her approximately 82 in 1865, mismatching Sarah Soper&rsquo;s reported age in the 1865 census. And admittedly, the census entries certainly look more like &ldquo;S&rdquo; than &ldquo;L&rdquo;, and the surname &ldquo;Soper&rdquo; can be found on Staten Island and Hempstead.</p></li></ul><p>All that said, I believe that the apparent &ldquo;Sarah Soper&rdquo;, &ldquo;mother&rdquo; in the 1865 census above is Sarah Loper, Charles&rsquo; mother-in-law, a widow at the time.</p><p>Elmira also had a niece, <a href=https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/36665791/juliet-shepard>Juliet (Loper) Shepard</a> (06 Jan 1845 to 02 Apr 1911), who is the daughter of Elmira&rsquo;s brother <a href=https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/33057122/erastus-harvey-loper>Erastus Harvey Loper</a> (1813 to 1860). Juliet was 20 in when the census was taken in 1865, matching the age of &ldquo;Julia&rdquo;. Her obituaries state that &ldquo;she was married to Mr. Shepard November 28, 1872&rdquo;, and so would still have the name Loper in 1865.</p><p>However, this may be somewhat obscured by two of Juliette&rsquo;s obituaries, that agree that &ldquo;her early life was spent in New York City, and following the death of her father in 1860, the family moved to this place [Huntington].&rdquo; Although, I would point out the vagueness of the relative time reference as well as the phrase &ldquo;the family&rdquo;.</p><div class=cols>

Shepard, editor of this paper, peacefully slept her life away Sunday morning at 9:30 o’clock. She died from paralysis, having had several shocks previous to the one Friday morning, which finally terminated in her death. Mrs. Shepard was born in Farmingdale, L. I. January 6, 1845, being the daughter of Erastus H. and Caroline Loper. Her early life was spent in New York City, and following the death of her father in 1860 the family moved to this place. She was married to Mr. Shepard November 28, 1872, and three children were born to them. George, the only son, died in childhood, and the other two survive, They are: Caroline, wife of Raymond S. Spears of Little Falls, N. Y., and Jessie L., an instructress in an institution for the blind in New York City. Mrs. Shepard also leaves two sisters, Mrs. William Sinell of Spring Valley, N. Y.; Mrs. Walter E. Bryant of this village, and two brothers, Edward H. Loper and William H. Loper, also of Huntington.</p><p>Early in life Mrs. Shepard united with the First Presbyterian Church and later, upon the inception of the Central Presbyterian Church, joined that organization. There are very few members, if any, who have been as devoted to the work of the church as Mrs. Shepard. As long as her health permitted she was a faithful attendant upon its services, and when she was unable to go her thoughts were centered upon the things of God’s house. Being enthusiastic upon the subject of missions, she was many years secretary and treasurer of the Ladies’ Missionary Society of the Central Presbyterian Church. Even up to the day of her death she was formulating plans along missionary lines. Her heart went out to the poor and many a local family will miss her little acts of kindness which she did without show or ostentation.</p><p>She was for many years a member of Dorcas Circle of King’s Daughters of this village, which sent a large number of gifts to the miners in Michigan and to the sick in hospitals and tenements, and she continuously sent supplies to city missions. She was also for many years an active worker for temperance in the ranks of the W. C. T. U, and a member of Ketewamoke Chapter, D. A. R.</p><p>The funeral services were held at the Central Presbyterian Church Tuesday afternoon at 2 o&rsquo;clock, the Rev. Samuel H. Seem being in charge.

Her death terminated a long period of failing health, and ended a serious illness of some days. Mrs. Shepard was born at Farmingdale on January 6, 1845, and was the daughter of Erastus H. and Caroline Loper. Her childhood was spent in the City of New York and in 1860, following the death of her father, the family removed to Huntington. She was married to Mr. Shepard on November 28, 1872. Three children were born to them, of whom two survive, a son haying died in childhood. The surviving children are Caroline, wife of Raymond S. Spears of Little Falls, N. Y., and Jessie L. Shepard, an instructress in the Institution for the Blind, in Manhattan. Mrs. Shepard in early life became a member of the First Presbyterian Church and later was one of the first members of the Central Church of Huntington. She was active in the work of that organization, and was prominent in connection with the Woman’s Home and Foreign Missionary Society, of which she was for a long period secretary, She had a wide acquaintance, and was highly regarded. Funeral services were held from the Central Church on Tuesday afternoon.</p></blockquote><figcaption>
