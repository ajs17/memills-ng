Mills (25 Mar 1819 to 01 Jan 1908) was distantly related to <a href=https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/66471939/william-b-hallock>William B. Hallock</a> (07 Jul 1822 to 29 Mar 1901), a prominent farmer in Caroline, and later Danby, who is closely associated with Thomas H. Howell, of Howell Brothers general store, also in Danby. Eventually, Hallock and Howell partnered on a dry goods store in Willseyville. Edward and William share the ancestor William Hallock (1610? to 1684), who was the only son of Peter Hallock, “the original” Hallock in America.</p><blockquote><p>“Our ancestors were undoubtedly of Puritan stock and strongly religious in their beliefs and practices.”</p></blockquote><p>According to the Mills genealogy, Edward&rsquo;s mother Mary Hallock is the daughter of Thomas Hallock.</p><figure class=image style=max-width:800px><img src=/family-of-edward-hallock-mills/assets/images/genealogy/1939-source2-pagea_hu6d120e47cc9252d911062b6d703a6d9b_679313_800x0_resize_q75_box.jpg width=800 height=686 alt><blockquote><p>SEVENTH GENERATION</p><p>No. 179.

(23 Apr 1915, The Long-Islander, Huntington NY, p5, nyhistoricnewspapers.org.)

William A. Hallock, Senior Secretary of The American Tract Society. His “Hallock Ancestry” was published in 1866, and tabulated these descendants down to that date. He says of his work:</p><p>“Having had the acquaintance of most of those whose testimony is here given, examined most of the wills, deeds and documents, visited the principal localities, ancient residents and graves, and carefully weighed the evidence in every case, I regard the main statements above as unquestionably reliable.”</p><p>With the work of Dr. William A. Hallock as a starting point, his nephew, Charles Hallock, M.A., continued the investigation and tabulation and published his “Hallock Ancestry” in 1906. These two capable and painstaking workers have performed a service that would be impossible at this late day, and have built a trustworthy foundation upon which this somewhat imposing superstructure is erected.</p><p>The work has extended itself beyond the anticipation of the writer and has practically absorbed his time and attention the past three years. It has necessitated the writing of more than 1000 letters, and tabulates the contributions of 300 co-workers. The friendly interest and encouraging words of these helpers is fully appreciated and thankfully acknowledged.

Some parts of this area were highly disturbed by recent activities, but it also included the pristine Hallock Pond and large areas of wooded and semi-wooded wildlife habitat.

That will is signed William Hallock, but the copyist, whose rescript is of record, has inadvertantly subscribed it Holyoake, a noticeable departure from the original Holyoke. Recognising these Discrepancies in the spelling, which are conspicuous on gravestones and legal documents along the family line for the preceding forty years, the logical conclusion would be that well authenticated facts of long standing, and always accepted as historical data, have simply been overlaid by a mirage resulting from a distortion and interchange of family patronimics.</p><p>If Hallock is not a diatonic of Holyoke, whence and how did it originate? It is not common in England today, and is not’of record at Yarmouth or Hingham whence Rev. Youngs and his company migrated.</p><p>The name Holyoke has been known in England for centuries, and there is a family coat of arms. One Edward Holyoke migrated from Stafford Co. in 1639, and was afterward President of Harvard College. His son Elizur Holyoke became well known in Northwestern Massachusetts in 1654 from having received a grant of land near Northampton ; and Mt. Holyoke is named for him because he camped at its base while land looking. The family arms appear in his will (1711). He had a son Edward Augustus, who lived to be nearly 100 years old.</p></blockquote><figcaption><p>— <cite>1928, <em>A Hallock genealogy: an attempt to tabulate and set in order the numerous descendants of Peter Hallock, who landed at Southold, Long Island, New York about the year 1640 and settled at Aquebogue, near Mattituck</em> by Lucius Henry Hallock, p12, familysearch.org. </cite><a class=origversion href=/family-of-edward-hallock-mills/assets/images/hallock/hallock-genealogy-tabulation-p12.jpg>View largest available size.</a></figcaption><aside></aside></figure></p><figure class=image style=max-width:800px><img src=/family-of-edward-hallock-mills/assets/images/hallock/hallock-genealogy-tabulation-p15_hu5d30b015a8a6b31e31b6c67e73bb993a_332960_800x0_resize_q75_box.jpg width=800 height=427 alt><blockquote><p>There is little doubt that the name of Peter Hallock, in England was HOLYOKE. He may have changed his name to facilitate his departure at a time when many were prevented from leaving by order of the King, and that upon arrival he continued this change of name which was variously spelled as found in documents and records of these early days.</p><p>Quoting from the “Genealogical and Family History of the State of Connecticut,” by the Lewis Historical Publishing Co. of New York, the spelling of the name is given as: Holyeake, Holliok, Halliock, Halleck, Hollioak, Hallick, Hallack, Hollyoake, and Hallock, all diatonics of Holyoke.</p><p>If there is any doubt as to the authenticity of PETER, the father of us all, the continual recurrence of this name in the early generations is an abiding evidence of the existence of an ancestor of that name who walked about in the flesh, and was known to them. It occurs 22 times in our records of these early generations.</p></blockquote><figcaption><p>— <cite>1928, <em>A Hallock genealogy: an attempt to tabulate and set in order the numerous descendants of Peter Hallock, who landed at Southold, Long Island, New York about the year 1640 and settled at Aquebogue, near Mattituck</em> by Lucius Henry Hallock, p15, familysearch.org. </cite><a class=origversion href=/family-of-edward-hallock-mills/assets/images/hallock/hallock-genealogy-tabulation-p15.jpg>View largest available size.</a></figcaption><aside></aside></figure></p><figure class=image style=max-width:800px><img src=/family-of-edward-hallock-mills/assets/images/hallock/Hallock-Coat-of-Arms_hu79fd28df8682df54d297bb4d25e4e1e4_209947_800x0_resize_q75_box.jpg width=800 height=655 alt><figcaption><p>— <cite>Holyoke-Hallock Coat of Arms, familysearch.org. </cite><a class=origversion href=/family-of-edward-hallock-mills/assets/images/hallock/Hallock-Coat-of-Arms.jpg>View largest available size.</a></figcaption><aside></aside></figure></p><figure class=image style=max-width:800px><img src=/family-of-edward-hallock-mills/assets/images/hallock/hallock-genealogy-tabulation-p18_hu26594ddbc1d9a9ec0607cc16b2eadfd2_530755_800x0_resize_q75_box.jpg width=800 height=819 alt><blockquote><p>THE HOLYOKE-HALLOCK ARMS</p><p>ARMS: Azure, a chevron, argent, coticed, or, between three crescents of the second.</p><p>CREST: A crescent, argent.</p><p>(Another crest is a cubic arm erect, habited gules cuffed argent, holding in the hand proper an oak branch fruited or)</p><p>&mldr;</p><p>We conclude that the Holyoke Arms, as they appear upon this page, can be honorably appropriated by descendants of the original PETER HALLOCK who are interested in the subject of Heraldry, and desire to adopt a Crest for family use.
