                <p>Before calling Mott&rsquo;s Corners home, the Mills moved to Corfu NY in the early 1860&rsquo;s where Edward, along with partners Charles Pine and James Hillyer, started E. H. Mills &amp; Co. &ldquo;cash store&rdquo; offering general merchandise and dry goods. Horace clerked in his father’s store, and Mary Ann was a member of First Presbyterian Church of Corfu.</p>
<p>The Mills, including Emily at just over one year old, are included in the 19 June 1860 Federal Census in Staten Island:</p>

<p>Documentation suggests the Mills family moved from Staten Island to Corfu sometime between 01 Sept 1862 and 01 May 1863, dates that correspond with tax assessment records of the time:</p>

<p>The tax assessments are divided by &ldquo;districts&rdquo; then further subdivided into &ldquo;divisions&rdquo; at which point, individuals and businesses are listed together alphabetically. Beginning with entries recorded 01 May 1863, for district 29, division 12, and each year thereafter, there are two entries for E. H. Mills &amp; Co. and Edward H. Mills. The 1862 document shown, recorded on 01 Sep 1862, has no such entries where they would be expected, strongly suggesting the family had not yet arrived in the area. Of course, these are just record dates, but they do give us a better defined window for when the family moved. This time period overlaps Emily&rsquo;s fourth birthday as well as the issuance of the Emancipation Proclamation, five days after the Battle of Antietam, the Confederate invasion of Maryland that took place just 200 miles from Castleton. However, even if the above interpretation of these documents is correct, it could still very well be that the family moved as early as the Summer of 1862.</p>
<p>As can be seen in the 1863 tax assessment documents, the Mills&rsquo; store is entered as &ldquo;Mills E. H. &amp; Co.&rdquo;, showing that it was already operating by 01 May 1863, and I suspect that it was always in the Kinne building, although I don&rsquo;t know that for a fact. In the following property timeline provided by Allan Starkweather, Corfu Village Historian, I suspect that the 1866 date may have been derived from the 1866 Porter Store advertisement shown elsewhere. I can find no evidence in the Genesee County Clerk&rsquo;s Office deed indexes that Edward ever owned the store property.</p>

<p>There is also a June 1863 Civil War Draft Registration record in Genesee County for Edward where his occupation was listed as &ldquo;merchant&rdquo;:</p>

<p>It would appear that &ldquo;James M. Hillyer&rdquo; is an error as the James Hillyer that is closely associated with Charles Pine in the Staten Island grocery business was James <strong>A.</strong> Hillyer.</p>
<p>From the documents available to me, that include city directories and census data, I see no evidence that James Hillyer or Charles Pine ever lived in Corfu, and instead multiple sources in the 1860&rsquo;s and 1870&rsquo;s tie them only to Castleton, and I get the sense that they were probably more in the role of investors and possibly advisers and likely not involved in the day-to-day operations of the store.  For more information on Charles Pine and James Hillyer, see <a href="https://memills.com/family-of-edward-hallock-mills/topics/staten-island/">The Mills Family in Staten Island</a>.</p>
<p>The following map images and associated business directories show both the E. H. Mills &amp; Co. general store as well as the Mills&rsquo; home in Corfu in the same locations in 1866 and 1876. E. H. Mills &amp; Co. was also referred to, on these maps and directories at least, as &ldquo;Mills Cash Store&rdquo; or just simply &ldquo;Cash Store.&rdquo;</p>

In 1876, a Female Department was established; in 1886, the name was changed to the State Industrial School. In 1907, it was renamed the State Agricultural &amp; Industrial School and moved to Industry, New York. Its former drill hall was transformed into Edgerton Park Arena.

<p>There are records of a number of &ldquo;lodges&rdquo; of the Independent Order of Good Templars in the Batavia area. There was at least briefly a Corfu lodge of the Good Templars, although I don&rsquo;t yet know if Emily was a member there. This lodge apparently disbanded prior to 1885.</p>

<p>Edward Hallioch Mills Died Jan 1st 1908 at 3 o&rsquo;clock in the afternoon. He was born at Smithtown L.I. March 25, 1819 - lacking less than 3 mos. of 89 yrs.</p>
<p>In Mar. 1879 He came to Brookton from Corfu N.Y. with his family and has lived among us nearly 29 years.</p>
<p>He united with this Ch. Dec. 13, 1896. A few remarks were made by Rev. Woodworth, Jan 3. The trend of thought was that a good man had gone - to which every heart present I feel sure responded. His interest in this Ch was unwavering and his loss seems irreparable. His body was taken to Corfu where his first wife and two sons are buried.</p>
<p>In this connection it seems proper to mention the death of Mrs. Mary A. Mills, although she died Dec. 28, 1895, yet I find no mention of it in these records. She was born at Hempstead L. I. Feb 8, 1819. Mrs. Mills was a member of the First Presbyterian Church of Corfu N.Y. She united with this Ch by letter June 13, 1880. Her life was a blessing to all who knew her.

<li>Variations of Edward&rsquo;s middle name exist, such as &ldquo;Hallioch&rdquo; and &ldquo;Halloch&rdquo;, however these seem to be errors, as Edward&rsquo;s middle name appears to be taken from his mother&rsquo;s maiden name: &ldquo;Hallock.&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;Rev. Woodworth&rdquo; refers to Reverend Allen Beach Woodworth (1837-1910), whose obituary in the Ithaca Daily News (12 Sep 1910, p3) states was the long-time pastor of the Brookton Baptist Church. This was a transition period between pastors for the Congregational Church, and in both the Ithaca Daily News and the historical records of Caroline Valley Federated Church, Reverend Woodworth is noted as performing Sunday services at the Congregational Church as well as officiating funerals for Congregation members during this time, presumably helping out in his retirement. Church records are vague on the point, but it&rsquo;s quite likely he helped out irregularly over many months as the Congregational Church needed his services. In the Mills&rsquo; store sales journals, Emily notes paying Reverend Woodworth $3.00 for attending Edward&rsquo;s funeral.</li>

The deceased was the wife of Edward H. Mills who was for many years a prominent merchant in this village who removed to Tompkins county sixteen years ago, re-engaging in mercantile pursuits, and where he has since resided.</p>
<p>Mrs. Mills was in usual health a week ago yesterday morning, but before night complained of a soreness in one of her fingers. Her daughter examined it and found what appeared to be a small splinter of wood, which she removed and which appeared to relieve her, but blood poisoning ensued and she continued to grow worse until Saturday, when death relieved her of her suffering. Her remains were accompanied by her husband and an only daughter, Emily Mills, who alone survive her and who possess the heartfelt sympathy of many friends in this vicinity who remember her as a kind friend and a devoted Christian whose sublime faith made her life beautiful and to the last degree exemplary.</p>
<p>Mr. Mills and daughter spent last night with Mr. and Mrs. W. W. McGregor and returned home this morning.</p>

<p>DEVASTATING FLAMES EAT OUT A SQUARE IN THE VERY HEART OF ITS BUSINESS PORTION.</p>
<p>SIX BUILDINGS BURN</p>
<p>PROPERTY VALUED AT $18,700 GOES UP IN SMOKE IN A REMARKABLY SHORT TIME.</p>
<p>Fire Started, Evidently From Spontaneous Combustion, in the Paint Room in Palmer &amp; Wagner&rsquo;s Hardware Store and Spread With Terrible Rapidity—That Structure, the Central Hotel, the Methodist Church, the Only Brick Building in the Place, Mrs. A. E. Ogden’s Store and Residence Property and Two Other Structures Quickly Consumed — Firemen, Without Any Apparatus of Value, Worked Like Trojans and Finally Got the Flames Under Control—The Total Amount of Insurance Only $8,750.</p>
<p>A great black hole in the heart of the business portion of Corfu is a monument to the awful power of devastating flames. Within a comparatively brief space of time late yesterday afternoon half a dozen buildings in that village went up in smoke and $18,700 worth of property was destroyed, upon which there was aggregate insurance of only $8,750, The burned section covers a square at the corner of Main and Alabama streets, north of the former and east of the latter. In addition a barn in the rear of a house on the west side of Alabama street was burned.</p>
<p>One of the buildings consumed was the Methodist-Protestant church on Alabama street, the only brick structure in the place, The other places destroyed were Palmer &amp; Wagner&rsquo;s hardware store on Main street, in which the fire started; the Central hotel just east of the hardware store; Maynard &amp; Stevens&rsquo;s annex, A variety store on the corner of Main and Alabama streets, opposite that firm’s main store; Mrs. A. E. Ogden’s dwelling, in the rear of and connected with Maynard &amp; Stevens’s annex, and a building between the dwelling and the Methodist church in which Daniel Schelt&rsquo;s shoe shop and D. A. Schelt’s barber shop were located, the latter having living apartments on the second floor. With only a small hand engine and a hook and ladder truck in the way of fire fighting apparatus the village was completely at the mercy of the flames for a time. The hardest kind of work on the part of men, women and children and the fact that there was no wind when the conflagration was at its height were all that saved the village from almost complete destruction. Corfu has had several bad fires, but this one, beyond a doubt, was the most disastrous in its history.</p>
<p>The only theory that can be considered in regard to the origin of the fire is that it was caused by spontaneous combustion. It started about 5:15 o&rsquo;clock In the oil and paint department of Palmer &amp; Wagner&rsquo;s hardware store, A narrow, two-story structure, about 75 feet long. Charles Palmer, son of the senior member of the firm and a clerk in the store, and Charles Collins, a painter, were in the paint room at the time.</p>
<p>“Mr. Collins came in to purchase some japan drier,” Mr. Palmer told a reporter tor THE NEWS, &ldquo;I was pouring it from a 5-gallon can into a quart can, which Mr. Collins was holding, when suddenly, without a moment’s warning, we were encircled by flames. The blaze seemed tostart from the floor, but communicated instantly to the japan.</p>
<p>“I threw the can out of a window and ran out into the street and shouted fire. I then started back in to lock the safe, which was about in the center of the store, but it was so hot that I couldn’t get to it. The floor of the paint room was saturated with oil, so the fire spread very rapidly.</p>
<p>“Mr, Collins followed me out of the store with his clothing on fire. Both of his hands were badly burned before we could put the fire out.”</p>
<p>A general alarm Was quickly sounded on the Presbyterian church bell and the fire company had its hand engine on the scene in a few minutes. The one small stream thrown from it had not the slightest effect upon the fames, which soon burst through the roof and high into the air, scattering blazing brands upon the roofs of adjoining buildings. Every able-bodied person in the village turned out to and the firemen, and informal bucket brigades and protective companies were quickly formed.</p>
<p>It being evident at the outset that the hardware store was doomed the people directed their attention to endeavoring to save adjoining property. The Central hotel, owned and occupied by William Dickinson, a 2 story building about fifty feet square, was situated close to the hardware store on the east. It was quickly seen that that, too, was bound to go and willing bands hastily removed as much of its contents as possible, The structure was soon wrapped in flames. There was a narrow  row alley on the west side of the hardware store, separating it from the 2 story structure on the corner of Main and Alabama streets, owned by Mrs. A. E. Ogden. The front half of the building was occupied by Maynard &amp; Stevens, who had a variety store there, managed by Ray Duguid, while the rear half Mrs. Ogden, her daughter, Mrs. Emma Bradley, and her grandson, Ray Bradley, occupied as a residence. The Bell Telephone company had a pay station there. This structure caught fire almost as soon as the hotel and burned just as rapidly. Nothing was saved from the store, but some of the furniture in the residence portion was got out safely.</p>
<p>Daniel Schelt’s small 2-story building was located but a few feet north of the Ogden structure on the east side of Alabama street and west of the rear end of the Palmer &amp; Wagner store. The contents of D. A. Schelt’s barber shop and a part of the effects in his living rooms on the second floor were gotten out before the building caught fire, but nothing was saved from Daniel Schelt&rsquo;s shoe store and shop on the first floor.</p>
<p>Next north of the Schelt building on Alabama street was the Methodist church, which, as it was a tall brick building, having a basement under the auditorium, it was hoped could be saved, Burning brands fell thick and fast, however, upon the shingled roof, well seasoned by years of exposure, and in a remarkably short time the whole interior of the edifice was a roaring furnace. The well-built brick walls refused to give way to the power of the flames, however, and this fact kept the fire from</p>

<p>Continued from first page.</p>
<p>spreading further to the north. On they opposite side of Alabama street Dr. F. W. Crane’s handsome residence is situated. It looked for a time as though that would go, too, but by the hardest kind of work it was saved. Brands were carried over and by it, however, to a barn owned by Mrs. Anna E. Edwards, located in the rear of Mrs. Edwards&rsquo;s house on Main street. The barn burned very rapidly. A horse, several vehicles and harnesses were gotten out, but a  cutter, a quantity of farming implements and hay and grain were burned, The barn was the last structure to be consumed. Several other buildings caught fire a number of times, but the flames were quickly put out. It was feared that the Barden Hall building, a large structure on Main street, east of the Central hotel, would burn, but it has a slate roof and this made it possible to more easily protect it from the flames. It was on fire, however, several times. Burning brands also set fire to the residences of Dr. Bates and George. M. Bailey, fully 300 feet west of Alabama street on Main street, but hardly any damage was done there.</p>
<p>Considering the fact that they had practically nothing to work with the firefighters did remarkable work in preventing a further spread of the conflagration, A request for aid was sent to Batavia about 6 p.m., when it looked as though the whole town was going, and the Central officials here got an engine and a flat car ready. As Corfu has no waterworks system, however, the Batavia department&rsquo;s apparatus would have been useless, so none of the companies responded. Later the Corfu people telegraphed to Buffalo for assistance. A fire engine was loaded on a flat car in that city and a telegram was then sent to Corfu asking if it should be sent. By that time the fire was under control and the Buffalonians were told not to come, About 10:30 o&rsquo;clock last night a strong wind came up, which sent clouds of sparks flying from the smouldering ruins and it was feared for a time that there might be more trouble, but a number of men stayed up all night Keeping a close watch and no new fires broke out.</p>
<p>The heaviest sufferers as a result of the fire are Palmer &amp; Wagner. Their loss is nearly $6,500 and they had a total of $4,200 insurance on the building and stock. They recently increased their already large stock by adding over $600 worth of goods to it, Everything in the store, including the books, was consumed. The firm will rebuild immediately.</p>
<p>The next heaviest loser is William Dickinson, proprietor of the Central hotel. His loss is close to $4,300, He had $2,500 insurance on his building, but nothing on the contents. Most of his furniture was burred and he lost several hundred dollars worth of liquors.</p>
<p>The Methodist church was worth probably about $3,000, and there was not a cent of insurance upon it. All that was saved from the building were the organ and pulpit Bible. It is doubtful if the church will be rebuilt, as the Methodist society is small in numbers.</p>
<p>Mrs. A. E. Ogden’s loss is fully $3,000. She had $1,000 insurance on her building, but none om contents. Most of her household goods burned up. Maynard &amp; Stevens’s variety stock in the same building was insured for $500, which will cover the loss.</p>
<p>Daniel Schelt&rsquo;s building was insured for $400, which will half cover the loss on it. He lost about $100 on the contents, with no insurance, D. A. Schelt lost about $100 on furniture and barber shop fixtures, with no insurance. Mr. Schelt will rebuild at once.</p>
<p>Mrs. A.A. Edwards insured her barn on Wednesday for $150. Her loss is about $400.</p>
<p>Of Palmer &amp; Wagner’s insurance John C. Holmes of Batavia had $1,000 on the building and a like sum on the stock and S. A. Sherwin of Batavia had $1,500 on the stock and tools and $200 on the building, The remaining $500 was held by Dwight Dimock of Corfu, In whose agency all of the balance of the burned property was insured.</p>
<p>The Corfu Fire company had arranged for a dance at the Union hotel last night and the programme was carried out, although it was pretty late before the festivities commenced. The event was well attended.</p>

By this time several thousand people from the surrounding country were present and doing all they could.</p>
<p>Word was wired to Batavia, in the excitement of the moment, for those companies, and Supt. Hay of the Central had an engine and flat car ready at 6 o&rsquo;clock, but it was decided not to send them as they would be useless, Corfu not having any waterworks system.</p>

<p>When Edward and Emily returned to Corfu with Mary Ann&rsquo;s remains, they spent the evening at the home of the MacGregors. The MacGregors arrived in Corfu just a few years after the Mills family, and the maps above indicate that the MacGregors lived across the street from the Mills&rsquo; home in Corfu. The MacGregors also attended the Presbyterian Church that Mary Ann attended.</p>

<p>Death of an Aged and Highly Esteemed Resident of Corfu.</p>
<p>Corfu, Nov. 6.—William W. MacGregor, an old and highly esteemed resident of Corfu, died at 3:30 o’clock yesterday morning from the infirmities of age. He had been in very good health and walked down town nearly every day until a month ago, when he fell and had not been well since. His mental faculties were somewhat impaired.</p>
<p>Mr. MacGregor was born in London, Eng., on October 10, 1822, and in April 1851, came to America, going first to Akron, then Pavilion and coming to Corfu nearly fifty years ago. On April 19, 1856, he married Lucy Ann Sumner, who died on May 18, 1910. In September 1910, the only surviving member of his immediate family, his sister, Miss Sophia MacGregor, left her home in Sussex, Eng., to come to America for the first time, to make her home with her brother. She is 83 years of age. Besides his sister Mr. MacGregor leaves several nephews and nieces.</p>
<p>Mr. MacGregor was apprenticed as a saddler in Perth, Scotland, and continued as a harness maker in this country until April 1900, when he sold his business at Corfu to M. L. Hanford. He was secretary of the Evergreen Hill Cemetery Association when it was organized on February 9, 1878, and was its treasurer for many years, resigning from that office six years ago. He had served as justice and had been town clerk, village clerk and notary public. He was a member of the Presbyterian church.</p>
<p>In a letter written to his sister on March 18, 1851, from Edinburgh, Scotland, Mr. MacGregor said: “On the 28th of this month I sail from Greenock for New York in the ship ‘Adonis.’ You know I long wished to emigrate and now the time has come. My berth is taken and part of my passage paid. The ‘Adonis’ is a very large vessel, 1,200 tons burden, and will take out a great many emigrants, I believe two or three hundred. I have taken what is called an immediate passage which costs four pounds.”</p>
<p>Mr. MacGregor’s funeral will be held from the house at 3:30 o’clock tomorrow afternoon. The interment will be in the Evergreen Hill cemetery.</p>

<p>Although Mary Ann was a member of the Presbyterian Church in Corfu, the interconnections with the Congregationalists are interesting nonetheless:</p>

The Congregationalist Church was active in Corfu from 1810-1830s. It never had its own building. It spent a few years as part of the Presbyterian Church,  then ceased to exist.

  <h4>Congregationalist Church</h4>
  <p>The Rev. John Spencer established a Congregationalist Church at Long's Corners [Corfu] in 1810. It was the first religious society in the Pembroke area. A permanent building was never built, they would occasionally meet at various homes. The Rev. Spencer had trouble finding people who were interested in religion. It was said that, "religion had not gone west of the Genesee River."
  </p>
  <p>
  When the Presbyterian Church was founded in 1817 the Congregationalists combined with them. By the 1840s most of them were gone.
  </p>
  <h4>Presbyterian Church</h4>
  <p>The Rev. Hugh Wallis Founded the Presbyterian Church at Long's Corners [Corfu] in 1817. The constitution for the "First Presbyterian Society in Pembroke" drawn up in 1818. They build a building at 63 Allegany in 1831. And it is still in use today.
  </p>
  <p>There was a lot of dissention in the church by 1831. Two factions of Presbyterians and the Congregationalists were doing a lot of bickering. The Genesee Presbytery recommended that the church be dissolved. Later in 1831, the church was disbanded and the "Presbyterian Church of N. Pembroke" was formed. Most of the records of the first church were destroyed. In 1834, it was renamed the "Corfu United Presbyterian Church." The Congregationalist's never did reform.

<h4>Corfu United Presbyterian Church</h4>
<p>In 1817, the Rev. Hugh Wallis, a missionary under the Holland Land Company, found a religious society already established in the Pembroke township. He gathered together some more people and formed a congregation under the authority of the Presbyterian Church. As was the custom with Land Companies, four acres was granted for an established congregation to build a house of worship. The church sold the land in "London," now the Lover's Lane Road area) for $400 and used it towards the construction of a building at Longs Corners. The present sanctuary in Corfu was begun in 1829 and had a seating capacity of 100 persons. Over a split in doctrine the church dissolved. The new church immediately arising was called the Presbyterian Church in North Pembroke. Because of the rough times during the Civil War not much is known of the church history between 1834-1870. Like most churches of the time it barely kept its head above water while the women supported the meeting house in the absence of men. They oftentimes went into debt-an elder holding a note for the church. He was repaid in time and gave the interest free. The largest debt contracted was $25 for the repair of pew cushions. It took the ladies five years to repay the note held by Elder Whittlesey. After the war a large revival was held. That and a large movement to the mid- west changed the church rolls drastically. In 1887 there was a large scale move towards discipline and inactive members were excommunicated. Several cases were tried before session. About this time session indicated the evils of Sunday newspapers to the congregation.</p>
<p>In 1910 the Methodist and Universalist Churches disbanded strengthening the Presbyterian congregation. The turn of the century was a time of prosperity. In 1903 Cyrus Carrier became clerk of the session. In 1953 he was honored for over 50 years of well-kept books. In 1928 Rev. William Easton was called to pastor the church. He held the distinction of the longest pastorate in the church's history — 15 years. Before that pastors continued their relationship with the church for an average of 3 or 4 years. Rev. Paul Hagen came as a supply minister in 1943 and was asked to' stay in 1944. In 1947 Dr. Bergen accepted the call to the ministry, at that time the attendance was 240 members. In 1955, when his ministry was ended with his death the membership was 240. Rev. Sheldon Dodds supplied and in 1957 Rev. George Fritting was called as pastor. He was followed by Rev. James Bower in 1963 and Rev. Richard Murdoch in 1967.Rev. Charles Alexander has served since 2003.</p>

<p>I do not have any records from the church on hand, prior to the early 1900s.  Our church started in 1814, which means she would have been involved in our church at the very early years of our church opening as Pembroke Society.
</p>
<p>I did send out a message to see if there are still any records from the start of the church, but truth be told, back then, record keeping wasn't exactly a big thing. and if anything was still available, it would have been transferred over, and over again.
