H. Mills. Both Jonas and Emily clerked at E. H. Mills. Emily took over the store after Edward&amp;rsquo;s death and operated it under the name M. E. Mills from 1909 until her death in 1937. Soon thereafter, Jessie Brewer took over the store and ran it under her name for a dozen years, primarily as a notions store with a lending library in the back. In 1961, Charles Vorhis purchased the building and moved the post office there from what is presently known as Brookton&amp;rsquo;s Market. The Mills&amp;rsquo; store structure survives today and is located at 484 Brooktondale Road, better known to current residents as &amp;ldquo;the old postoffice&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Mills Family in Corfu NY</title><link>https://memills.com/family-of-edward-hallock-mills/topics/corfu/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://memills.com/family-of-edward-hallock-mills/topics/corfu/</guid><description>&lt;p>Before calling Mott&amp;rsquo;s Corners home, the Mills moved to Corfu NY in the early 1860&amp;rsquo;s where Edward, along with partners Charles Pine and James Hillyer, started E. H. Mills &amp;amp; Co. &amp;ldquo;cash store&amp;rdquo; offering general merchandise and dry goods. Horace clerked in his father’s store, and Mary Ann was a member of First Presbyterian Church of Corfu.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Mills Family in Staten Island NY</title><link>https://memills.com/family-of-edward-hallock-mills/topics/staten-island/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://memills.com/family-of-edward-hallock-mills/topics/staten-island/</guid><description>&lt;p>Edward and Mary Ann began their marriage in Staten Island NY where they lived throughout the 1850&amp;rsquo;s and where each Mills child was born. Here, Edward presumably learned the grocery business from Mary Ann&amp;rsquo;s brother, &lt;a href="https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/199952123/charles-m-pine">Charles Mills Pine&lt;/a> (1812 to 08 Oct 1897), who eventually co-owned E. H. Mills &amp;amp; Co. in Corfu. Edward presumably worked in Pine&amp;rsquo;s general store, which was located in West New Brighton, also known as Factoryville, a neighborhood in the Staten Island town of Castleton, and was known as Pine Hillyer &amp;amp; Co. and then C. M. Pine &amp;amp; Son. The Mills are members of the Reformed Dutch Church of Port Richmond, where Charles Pine was a longtime member of the church consistory.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Hempstead NY and Pine, Seaman Genealogies</title><link>https://memills.com/family-of-edward-hallock-mills/topics/hempstead/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://memills.com/family-of-edward-hallock-mills/topics/hempstead/</guid><description>&lt;p>Edward presumably moved to Hempstead with his family in 1837.
