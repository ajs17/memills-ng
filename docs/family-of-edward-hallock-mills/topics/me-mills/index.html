H. Mills. Both Jonas and Emily clerked at E. H. Mills. Emily took over the store after Edward&rsquo;s death and operated it under the name M. E. Mills from 1909 until her death in 1937. Soon thereafter, Jessie Brewer took over the store and ran it under her name for a dozen years, primarily as a notions store with a lending library in the back. In 1961, Charles Vorhis purchased the building and moved the post office there from what is presently known as Brookton&rsquo;s Market. The Mills&rsquo; store structure survives today and is located at 484 Brooktondale Road, better known to current residents as &ldquo;the old postoffice&rdquo;.</p><blockquote><p>"...known as the "Store Property" on the southerly side of the highway, which is now and for a considerable time last past has been used and occupied by Miss Mills as a store."</p></blockquote><p>Mills&rsquo; store, Summer 2021:</p><figure class=image style=max-width:800px><img src=/family-of-edward-hallock-mills/assets/images/today/2021-08-07-484-Brooktondale-Road-looking-southeast_hu230b931b80f90e567af477d41d66f5c3_6691456_800x0_resize_q75_box.jpg width=800 height=479 alt><figcaption><p>— <cite>07 Aug 2021, Adam Smith. </cite><a class=origversion href=/family-of-edward-hallock-mills/assets/images/today/2021-08-07-484-Brooktondale-Road-looking-southeast.jpg>View largest available size.</a></figcaption><aside><div class=notes><ul></p><li>484 Brooktondale Road, Brooktondale NY.

From Molly Adams&rsquo; research notes in the Caroline History Room: &ldquo;Walker Personius was a Civil War veteran and the village postmaster in 1882. He seems to have been the owner of Mott&rsquo;s original store which he called Personius Hall. The building had a large meeting space on the second floor, with seats that folded down from the wall. Memorial Day (then called Decoration Day) processions always formed in front of that building (see photo) and perhaps the David Ireland Post of Civil War Veterans met in that building. It seems clear that the post office was still at 559 Brooktondale Road in 1882.&rdquo; I don&rsquo;t know what photo was being referenced in the preceding passage. From &ldquo;Tour 3 - P8&rdquo; in A Drive-by Tour of the Town of Caroline: &ldquo;1st Post Office & store, left &ndash; 559 Brooktondale Road. We think this building was build by Mr. Mott, who owned most of the land at that time. &mldr;The G.A.R. lined up here to march to the [Quick, presently Brookton] cemetery to put flowers on the graves. There was a tannery between this house and the next before 1853 owned by Silsbury & Lounsbery.&rdquo; Walker Personius and Edward Lounsbery were also charter members of the Congregational Church of Mott&rsquo;s Corners, presently called Caroline Valley Community Church, and were instrumental in its formation. George Richardson, who appears to have worked for Edward Mills at a time when Edward was Postmaster, eventually started his own grocery business in &ldquo;the old Personius store&rdquo; starting May 1897.</li></ul></div></aside></figure></div><p>It appears <a href=https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/189275611/george-h-richardson>George H.

This was a transition period between pastors for the Congregational Church, and in both the Ithaca Daily News and the historical records of Caroline Valley Federated Church, Reverend Woodworth is noted as performing Sunday services at the Congregational Church as well as officiating funerals for Congregation members during this time, presumably helping out in his retirement. Church records are vague on the point, but its quite likely he helped out irregularly over many months as the Congregational Church needed his services.

She advertised perhaps dozens of times in the Ithaca Daily Journal alongside the Vorhis Mill and the meat market that is attributed at one time to Clarence Wheeler, someone mentioned many times in the journals of George Jansen. The first such advertisement I could find was in the 29 Mar 1909 edition (exactly 30 years after the Mills moved to Motts Corners), and the last was on 30 Jun 1910. What follows are a sample of some of them, many of which were repeated for weeks at a time, and they provide a good sense of the diverse products offered in the small country store:</p><figure class=image style=max-width:500px><img src=/family-of-edward-hallock-mills/assets/images/1909-03-29-The-Ithaca-Daily-Journal-p9_hue83bcea8e6f61949eb8b2d73ea3e6560_55745_500x0_resize_box_3.png width=500 height=1243 alt><blockquote><p>M.

The term is chiefly in American English (the equivalent British term is haberdashery). It was also formerly used in the phrase &ldquo;Yankee notions&rdquo;, meaning American products.

I remember it as a dark place with long rows of counters on each side and tables and glass-topped counters in the middle. Emily Mills was a little woman, with her hair in a bun on top of her head, like Grandma Bacon&rsquo;s. She was quiet, neat, cheerful and always smiling.</p><p>She had yard goods, bias tape, combs, lace handerchiefs, and many things you could buy for presents for ten cents and up. There were racks of thread, needles, pins and all the things we needed for our 4-H projects.</p><p>She had groceries, and took butter and eggs in trade. Butter was weighed on her scales. The scales had a large scoop at one end, and little weights at the other. I don&rsquo;t remember her selling meat, but she probably did. Many people had kerosene lights then, and she sold it by the gallon. You took your container, and she filled it, usually with a potato on the end so it wouldn&rsquo;t spill. Marilyn and I would go do the shopping for Aunt Mina, with a cart in the Summer and a sled in the Winter to carry them home with.</p><p>Miss Mills also taught Sunday School at the Congregational Church and played the piano. It must have been a class for older people, as I never had her for a teacher.</p><p>I remember her as very kind, and I was shocked to learn someone had stolen things from her while she was busy with another customer.</p><p>She lived across the street from Dr. Lockwood, in a little house that sat back near the hill. Her father had the store before her. Apparently she never married. She had a woman who lived in and kept house for and cooked the meals, and would stay in the store while she ate lunch and supper. I can&rsquo;t remember her name, but she looked a great deal like Miss Mills.</p><p>After Miss Mills died, Jessie (Shurter) Brewer had a notions store here. No groceries, just sewing supplies, hosiery and a few dresses, etc. She also had a lending library in the back, where I found many western and mystery stories to read. She ran the store for some time, and I always enjoyed shopping there and talking to her. She had a bell on the door, that rang next door so she could come over when she had customers.</p><p>Upstairs the building had a long hall, with a stage at one end. There were outside stairs leading to the second floor, but I had not noticed much about it, until a traveling show had a performance here. Many buildings in the village had such &ldquo;halls&rdquo;.</p><p>Today the Postoffice is in this building and the upstairs is an apartment.</p></blockquote><figcaption><p>— <cite>Gertrude Conant.

E. MILLS, DEALER IN DRY GOODS, GROCERIES, HARDWARE AND CROCKERY, BROOKTON, N.Y.” On the inside is a calendar covering July 1909 to July 1910, a pack of needles and a fabric needle holder. The text says "This is a complete set of needles for all purposes. All the best imported. We would very much appreciate your patronage when anything in our line is needed.”</blockquote><p>We know a great deal about Emily through the activities of M. E. Mills, which Emily made a community focal point as a natural consequence of her many interests and activities, and intentional or not, had to have been excellent marketing for her store. (My impressions are that Emily took a great deal of pride in the running of her store and took its effective management very seriously and did indeed consider every opportunity to volunteer her store for free press and increased foot traffic, such as the regular millinery exhibits by Margaret LaBar.)</p><div class=cols><figure class=image style=max-width:350px><img src=/family-of-edward-hallock-mills/assets/images/1914-02-23-ithaca-journal_hue323f50427f1c441bc1d0c39d7978df3_67827_350x0_resize_q75_box.jpg width=350 height=226 alt><blockquote><strong>BROOKTON</strong>

Her name has several variations in spelling. In relation to the Mills’ store, it is consistently spelled “La Barre” however, Margaret did many similar store displays in which her name is consisently spelled “LaBarr”. The same is true of many of her mentions in the Danby gossip columns, where both “LaBarr” and “LaBar” are used. “LaBarr” is used in Margaret’s own notices and advertisements: she advertised the sale of millinery supplies from her home in Danby, and she also owned a home that she rented. The intermixing of “LaBar” and “LaBarr” occur over many decades, and even her father’s obituary spells the family name as “LaBarr”. Yet the grave markers say “LABAR” and census data consisently show spelling/capitalization of “LaBar”.</div></aside></figure></p><figure class=image style=max-width:350px><img src=/family-of-edward-hallock-mills/assets/images/1914-10-23-ithaca-journal_hu6f61dbe9809c4b1ec30e78d5d7cde315_31978_350x0_resize_q75_box.jpg width=350 height=100 alt><blockquote>A case containing a pair of spectacles was found in front of the Congregational church a week ago last Saturday.

The antique metal ceiling was also added.</p><p>There are potentially artifacts from the time of Mills&rsquo; store in the building. There are a number of items that predate Vorhis&rsquo; ownership, including old wooden mailboxes that may have been used when Edward was postmaster. There are also old wooden boxes with food brands painted on them.</p><p>The basement is accessed from a door that opens in the floor. This door is near a large exterior door where deliveries were likely made. The basement floor is fine dirt.</p><p>Frank speculates that the upstairs rear room may have been used for masonic meetings, and pointed out that an interior door contained a large peep-hole.</p><p>Mills&rsquo; store is easily visible from most windows in most rooms of Mills&rsquo; Home.</p><h2 id=notes-for-future-researchers>Notes for Future Researchers</h2><p>A summary of Mills&rsquo; store deeds:</p><figure class=table id=mills-store-deeds><table><thead><tr><th>Book</th><th>Book num</th><th>Page num</th><th>Document date</th><th>Recorded date</th><th>Grantor</th><th>Grantee</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Caroline Deeds</td><td>1</td><td>556</td><td>1868-05-16</td><td>1868-06-02</td><td>Willis Shurter</td><td>George E.

I could not find anything in the volumes themselves directly identifying the store these journals were for, but I only reviewed the books briefly. A note accompanying them indicated they were donated by Frank Proto, owner of the Mills&rsquo; store location at the time of this writing.</p><p>Given that Frank donated them, and that the style of record keeping is quite similar to known Mills sales journals, I initially hoped these might be earlier books of E. H. Mills&rsquo; general store. When asked for more information on their origin, Barbara Kone said they came from Frank&rsquo;s basement, and when pressed further for which basement, she said &ldquo;from the Mill&rdquo; meaning the basement of Dalebrook, also owned by Frank Proto at the time of this writing, and at the time of the sales journals in question, was owned by Frank C. Vorhis, who also owned a general store next door in the location that eventually became Frank F. Mulks general store, and presently, Brookton&rsquo;s Market. In a later conversation with Frank Proto, he confirmed that he donated these volumes on &ldquo;permanent loan&rdquo; to the Caroline History Room, and that they came from the basement of Dalebrook, when Frank purchased the property from Charles Vorhis. According to the Brookton&rsquo;s Market 2011 Calendar, Frank Vorhis owned the store next door from the 1880&rsquo;s to its sale to the Mulks brothers in 1902, when it became known as Frank F. Mulks. That timeframe matches these journals, and it appears the prices used in the comparisons in the 2011 calendar came from these books.</p><p>My review led me to conclude there were possibly several different handwriting styles, and although I have not looked through the entries thoroughly, I spent a little time reviewing a random sampling of entries over several books and could not confidently identify any handwriting as Emily&rsquo;s, although occasionally I thought I might have seen an interesting similarity, I could not see that similarity consistently. Obviously a more careful examination should be done, but in the meantime, the weight of the evidence seems to favor these being the sales journals of Vorhis&rsquo; store.</p></div></article></main><aside><div><div><h3>LATEST POSTS</h3></div><div><ul><li><a href=/family-of-edward-hallock-mills/mills-family/buffalo-mills/>The Mills of Buffalo</a></li><li><a href=/family-of-edward-hallock-mills/mills-edward-hallock-1819/>Edward Hallock Mills</a></li><li><a href=/family-of-edward-hallock-mills/mills-mary-ann-1819/>Mary Ann Mills</a></li><li><a href=/family-of-edward-hallock-mills/mills-jonas-e-1852/>Jonas Edward Mills</a></li><li><a href=/family-of-edward-hallock-mills/mills-horace-f-1854/>Horace Franklin Mills</a></li></ul></div></div></aside><footer><hr><p><span xmlns:dct=http://purl.org/dc/terms/ property="dct:title">The Family of Edward H.
