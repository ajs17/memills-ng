                <p>After moving to Mott&rsquo;s Corners in Mar 1879, Edward restarted his general store on his own, now simply called E. H. Mills, where his surviving children Jonas and Emily clerked. Emily took over the store after Edward&rsquo;s death and operated it under the name M. E. Mills from 1909 until her death in 1937. Soon thereafter, Jessie Brewer took over the store and ran it under her name for a dozen years, primarily as a notions store with a lending library in the back. In 1961, Charles Vorhis purchased the building and moved the post office there from what is presently known as Brookton&rsquo;s Market. The Mills&rsquo; store structure survives today and is located at 484 Brooktondale Road, better known to current residents as &ldquo;the old postoffice&rdquo;.</p>

<p>
"...known as the "Store Property" on the southerly side of the highway, which is now and for a considerable time last past has been used and occupied by Miss Mills as a store."

<p>In the 1866 Photographic Atlas of Tompkins County by Stone &amp; Stewart, a map of Mott&rsquo;s Corners shows a structure labeled &ldquo;J. Shurter Store&rdquo; in the same approximate location as Mills&rsquo; Store.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/100594864/josiah-shurter">Josiah Shurter</a> (26 Apr 1815 to 05 Aug 1877) married <a href="https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/100594934/jane-shurter">Jane (Shutt) Shurter</a> (21 Nov 1825 to 23 Jun 1897). The land that starts just west of the lower bridge in Brooktondale and encompasses the area between the southern side of Brooktondale Road and Six Mile Creek, extending many acres westward, is referenced in the deed records of the Tompkins County Clerk as the Josiah Shurter Homestead.</p>
<p>Although Josiah is not listed in the directory below the Stone &amp; Stewart map, the first entry, &ldquo;E. C. Marsh&hellip;Grocery and Provision Store&rdquo; is almost certainly a reference to the J. Shurter Store. <a href="https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/28741041/edward-c-marsh">Edward C. Marsh</a> (23 Nov 1836 to 25 Jun 1907) is Josiah Shurter&rsquo;s son-in-law, and presumably Josiah&rsquo;s employee. As indicated in the 1865 New York State Census for Caroline, Edward and his wife Harriet (Shurter) Marsh were living in the home of Josiah Shurter. Both Josiah and Edward Marsh are identified as millers.</p>

<p>Also living with the Shurters at this time is another son-in-law, <a href="https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/100303590/william-benton-wolcott">William Benton Wolcott</a> (06 Oct 1832 to 25 Feb 1911) who married Josiah Shurter&rsquo;s daughter <a href="https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/187990128/ellen-a-aldrich_wolcott">Ellen A. (Shurter) Wolcott Aldrich</a> (07 Sep 1843 to 21 Apr 1928). William Wolcott was a <a href="#the-brewer-barn">carriage maker</a> and likely worked for Josiah and/or Josiah&rsquo;s son <a href="https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/162159964/willis-shurter">Willis Shurter</a> (1840 to 17 Jan 1914). William Wolcott was also the first owner of record of <a href="/family-of-edward-hallock-mills/mills-home/other-past-owners/">Mills&rsquo; Home</a>. Edward Marsh, William Wolcott and Willis Shurter fought in the Civil War in the years immediately prior.</p>
<p>Willis Shurter inherited much of his father Josiah&rsquo;s property and appeared to take over Josiah&rsquo;s businesses by the late 1860&rsquo;s. On 16 May 1868, &ldquo;Willis Shurter and Jane Shurter his wife&rdquo; sell the store property to <a href="https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/89338797/george-e-sanders">George E. Sanders</a> (16 Aug 1847 to 01 Nov 1889), and in the 1870 United States Federal Census for Caroline, Edward Marsh is a carpenter and George E. Sanders is listed in the census as &ldquo;clerk in store&rdquo; while George&rsquo;s father George T. Sanders is listed as a &ldquo;dealer in dry goods &amp; groceries (ret)&rdquo;.</p>

<p>George E. Sanders&rsquo; father, <a href="https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/89338795/george-townley-sanders">George Townley Sanders</a> (14 Nov 1818 to 04 May 1887), was a founding member of the <a href="/family-of-edward-hallock-mills/bcc/founding-documents/">Congregational Church of Mott&rsquo;s Corners</a>, as was his daughter <a href="https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/89338794/amanda-lounsbery">Amanda (Sanders) Lounsbery</a> (12 Oct 1842 to 13 Nov 1921) and her husband <a href="https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/89338793/edward-lounsbery">Edward Lounsbery</a> (11 Oct 1833 to 27 Nov 1904). Another daughter of George T. Sanders, <a href="https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/138388479/libbie-h-peck">Libbie H. (Sanders) Peck</a> (05 Nov 1857 to 04 Nov 1929), married <a href="https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/20462930/george-riley-peck">George Riley Peck</a> (14 May 1851 to 28 Nov 1916) in 1877. Edward Lounsbery and George Peck were both &ldquo;dealers in hides&rdquo; and operated a tannery, Lounsbery &amp; Peck, next to Walker V. Personius&rsquo; store at present-day 559 Brooktondale Road.</p>
<p>Although I can&rsquo;t yet say for certain where George T. Sanders&rsquo; grocery business was, I believe there is some circumstantial evidence to suggest that it was at 559 Brooktondale Road, for example: In the 1800&rsquo;s, it was common for local post offices to be located within a grocery store, with the owner as postmaster. There are several examples of this in Brooktondale alone, presumably including George T. Sanders who was appointed postmaster on 20 Jul 1861, and is replaced by Walker V. Personius on 16 Dec 1864, six months before George T. Sanders is recorded as &ldquo;dealer in dry goods &amp; groceries (ret)&rdquo; in the 1865 New York State Census for Caroline. It is claimed that this was Mott&rsquo;s original store in Mott&rsquo;s Corners, and the location of the first post office.</p>

<p>Presumably George E. Sanders worked for his father at that location before purchasing the J. Shurter Store lot. George E. Sanders&rsquo; Store was apparently the immediate predecessor of E. H. Mills&rsquo; general store, and the circumstantial evidence I have seen strongly suggests that Edward Mills began his store at the building then owned by Edward Lounsbery soon after, if not immediately upon, arriving at Mott’s Corners in March 1879. Consider the 1880 United States Federal Census for Caroline showing Edward is a &ldquo;merchant&rdquo; and his son Jonas is a &ldquo;clerk in store&rdquo;, that store presumably E. H. Mills.</p>

<li>&ldquo;Grand Army hall&rdquo; my be a reference to Personius Hall at present day 559 Brooktondale Road. From Molly Adams&rsquo; research notes in the Caroline History Room: &ldquo;Walker Personius was a Civil War veteran and the village postmaster in 1882. He seems to have been the owner of Mott&rsquo;s original store which he called Personius Hall. The building had a large meeting space on the second floor, with seats that folded down from the wall. Memorial Day (then called Decoration Day) processions always formed in front of that building (see photo) and perhaps the David Ireland Post of Civil War Veterans met in that building. It seems clear that the post office was still at 559 Brooktondale Road in 1882.&rdquo; I don&rsquo;t know what photo was being referenced in the preceding passage. From &ldquo;Tour 3 - P8&rdquo; in A Drive-by Tour of the Town of Caroline: &ldquo;1st Post Office &amp; store, left &ndash; 559 Brooktondale Road. We think this building was build by Mr. Mott, who owned most of the land at that time. &hellip;The G.A.R. lined up here to march to the [Quick, presently Brookton] cemetery to put flowers on the graves. There was a tannery between this house and the next before 1853 owned by Silsbury &amp; Lounsbery.&rdquo; Walker Personius and Edward Lounsbery were also charter members of the Congregational Church of Mott&rsquo;s Corners, presently called Caroline Valley Community Church, and were instrumental in its formation. George Richardson, who appears to have worked for Edward Mills at a time when Edward was Postmaster, eventually started his own grocery business in &ldquo;the old Personius store&rdquo; starting May 1897.</li>

<p>About 2 o&rsquo;clock this morning the thieves entered the Mills store and secured a quantity of shoes, files and other small articles and then crossed to the Mulks store and entered the storeroom in the back by breaking a window. They were unable to get into the main part of the store and gave up the job there without getting any further booty.</p>
<p>The owners of the two stores have no suspicions as to who committed the robbery but hereafter the places are to be carefully watched and if a repetition of the visit occurs there is likely to be some shooting.</p>

<p>I have seen perhaps more than a dozen volumes of sales journals and other financial record books that are in the possession of a local collector who told me he was contacted by Frank Proto at the time Frank took possession of the former Mills&rsquo; store building, and he was given the opportunity to go through the basement of the building and preserve anything of historical value.</p>

<p>Interestingly, the oldest of the volumes, labeled &ldquo;No. 41&rdquo; is the most important as it shows the records of E. H. Mills in the days immediately preceding Edward&rsquo;s death. It seems Emily herself (or perhaps Jessie Brewer after her) did not preserve the books from her father&rsquo;s time running the store.</p>

<ul>
<li>This page is the inside back cover of volume 41 of the Mills&rsquo; store sales journals show the store&rsquo;s business expenses in the final days of E. H. Mills and the transition after Edward&rsquo;s death to M. E. Mills. These books are hardcover, cloth.</li>
<li>While typical sales are entered in the books as you would expect, the family account records start in the back and are filled in toward the front.</li>
<li>The 22 Jan 1908 entry mentions Emily Hunting, who is likely <a href="https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/23991552/emily-mills-huntting">Emily Mills Huntting</a> (1849 to 1932). This indicates that Emily was still in contact with family in Long Island later in her life.</li>
<li>The 21 Jan 1908 entry appears to refer to services provided by Reverend Allen Beach Woodworth (1837-1910), who is also mentioned in Edward&rsquo;s obituary in the historical records of Caroline Valley Federated Church, reproduced elsewhere in this publication. The Reverend&rsquo;s obituary in the Ithaca Daily News (12 Sep 1910, p3) states he was the long-time pastor of the Brookton Baptist Church. This was a transition period between pastors for the Congregational Church, and in both the Ithaca Daily News and the historical records of Caroline Valley Federated Church, Reverend Woodworth is noted as performing Sunday services at the Congregational Church as well as officiating funerals for Congregation members during this time, presumably helping out in his retirement. Church records are vague on the point, but its quite likely he helped out irregularly over many months as the Congregational Church needed his services. The writing is a little unclear, but also considering the fact that she did not use the title &ldquo;Reverend&rdquo; suggests that perhaps the fee for the Reverend&rsquo;s services was being collected by his second wife Lorena, who was the same age as Emily.</li>
<li>The 23 Jan 1908 entry is presumably a reference to Ellen Gould.</li>

<p>The &ldquo;Mills Family a/c&rdquo; pages show the Mills&rsquo; business expenses, mostly paying for store inventory. In these earlier books, this information was at the end of the book, starting with the inside back cover and progressed toward the front over time, whereas retail sales, including what the family themselves took out of the store, were entered in the books in the normal order, starting from the front and working toward the back.</p>

<p>As you can see, these books contain many easily recognizable names of former Brookton residents, along with a glimpse into their regular purchases. It is interesting to note the store was closed on Sundays, but open on Christmas day, if a bit slow:</p>

You can almost imagine her confident and efficiently crisp pen strokes as she stands behind the counter of her store, attention focused on this page.</div></aside></figure></p>
<p>In the 1920&rsquo;s, more sophisticated business records emerge, both new types of records kept as well as a more formal breakdown of the store&rsquo;s inventory expenditures. These journals contained sample pages and instructions that Emily may have used to teach herself these new methods. This is further indication of Emily&rsquo;s character and how much pride she took in ownership of her store that she was continually teaching herself new practices, even after decades of daily work in this occupation.</p>

<p>As Molly Adams wrote in her &ldquo;Note&rdquo;, Emily began aggressively advertising the newly branded store in 1909. She advertised perhaps dozens of times in the Ithaca Daily Journal alongside the Vorhis Mill and the meat market that is attributed at one time to Clarence Wheeler, someone mentioned many times in the journals of George Jansen. The first such advertisement I could find was in the 29 Mar 1909 edition (exactly 30 years after the Mills moved to Motts Corners), and the last was on 30 Jun 1910. What follows are a sample of some of them, many of which were repeated for weeks at a time, and they provide a good sense of the diverse products offered in the small country store:</p>

<li>From <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Notions_(sewing)">Wikipedia</a>: &ldquo;In sewing and haberdashery, notions are small objects or accessories, including items that are sewn or otherwise attached to a finished article, such as buttons, snaps, and collar stays. Notions also include the small tools used in sewing, such as needles, thread, pins, marking pens, elastic, and seam rippers. The noun is almost always used in the plural. The term is chiefly in American English (the equivalent British term is haberdashery). It was also formerly used in the phrase &ldquo;Yankee notions&rdquo;, meaning American products. A fabric store will have a section or department devoted to notions, and a spool of thread is considered a notion.&rdquo;</li>

<p>In the Ithaca Daily Journal, 26 Aug 1909, pg 5, in an article &ldquo;Early History of Brookton Village&rdquo; M. E. Mills is listed as a &ldquo;present merchant&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Several descriptions of M. E. Mills exist, the most complete of which is Gertrude Conant&rsquo;s:</p>
<figure class="image" style="max-width:800px;"><img src="/family-of-edward-hallock-mills/assets/images/conant-gertrude-1_hue765127666cfbf8e6469d7251c4ddc99_920684_800x0_resize_q75_box.jpg" width="800" height="973" alt=""><blockquote><p>Emily Mills&rsquo; store was in the building where the Post Office is today. I remember it as a dark place with long rows of counters on each side and tables and glass-topped counters in the middle. Emily Mills was a little woman, with her hair in a bun on top of her head, like Grandma Bacon&rsquo;s. She was quiet, neat, cheerful and always smiling.</p>
<p>She had yard goods, bias tape, combs, lace handerchiefs, and many things you could buy for presents for ten cents and up. There were racks of thread, needles, pins and all the things we needed for our 4-H projects.</p>
<p>She had groceries, and took butter and eggs in trade. Butter was weighed on her scales. The scales had a large scoop at one end, and little weights at the other. I don&rsquo;t remember her selling meat, but she probably did. Many people had kerosene lights then, and she sold it by the gallon. You took your container, and she filled it, usually with a potato on the end so it wouldn&rsquo;t spill. Marilyn and I would go do the shopping for Aunt Mina, with a cart in the Summer and a sled in the Winter to carry them home with.</p>
<p>Miss Mills also taught Sunday School at the Congregational Church and played the piano. It must have been a class for older people, as I never had her for a teacher.</p>
<p>I remember her as very kind, and I was shocked to learn someone had stolen things from her while she was busy with another customer.</p>
<p>She lived across the street from Dr. Lockwood, in a little house that sat back near the hill. Her father had the store before her. Apparently she never married. She had a woman who lived in and kept house for and cooked the meals, and would stay in the store while she ate lunch and supper. I can&rsquo;t remember her name, but she looked a great deal like Miss Mills.</p>
<p>After Miss Mills died, Jessie (Shurter) Brewer had a notions store here. No groceries, just sewing supplies, hosiery and a few dresses, etc. She also had a lending library in the back, where I found many western and mystery stories to read. She ran the store for some time, and I always enjoyed shopping there and talking to her. She had a bell on the door, that rang next door so she could come over when she had customers.</p>
<p>Upstairs the building had a long hall, with a stage at one end. There were outside stairs leading to the second floor, but I had not noticed much about it, until a traveling show had a performance here. Many buildings in the village had such &ldquo;halls&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Today the Postoffice is in this building and the upstairs is an apartment.</p>

<li>Gertrude notes &ldquo;Many people had kerosene lights then, and she sold it by the gallon. You took your container, and she filled it, usually with a potato on the end so it wouldn&rsquo;t spill.&rdquo; In a journal entry on 08 Feb 1923, George Jansen notes that he took &ldquo;1 bin of potatoes&rdquo; to &ldquo;Miss Mills&rdquo;.</li>
<li>Dr. Benjamin Lockwood&rsquo;s house is present day 480 Brooktondale Road. Later, &ldquo;Dr. Mary&rdquo; Ridgway Tinker lived and practiced there for a time. Dr. Lockwood was also a member of Brookton Congregational Church, and he built the Dalebrook apartments on the foundation of the Grist Mill in the 1920&rsquo;s. After Dr. Lockwood&rsquo;s death, E. D. Shurter facilitated the placement of a plaque in Dr. Lockwood&rsquo;s honor outside Dalebrook that remains today.</li>
<li>The &ldquo;woman who lived in and kept house&rdquo; whose name Gertrude couldn&rsquo;t remember, is a reference to Ellen Gould.</li>

</ul>
</div></aside></figure>
<p>In one of the present-day photos of 484 Brooktondale Road, you can see the staircase on the side of building leading to the second floor, that Gertrude mentions. The second floor was known as &ldquo;Lounsbery Hall&rdquo; for owner Edward Lounsbery, and the <a href="/family-of-edward-hallock-mills/topics/temperance/">temperance</a> group, the Good Templars, of which Edward and Amanda were leading members, were known to often meet there. (George Richardson was also a member.)</p>
<p>The following is the clearest proof of the location of Lounsbery Hall:</p>

<p>Fancy articles, aprons, candy etc., will be disposed of at strictly reasonable prices.</p>
<p>Doors open at 6:30 o’clock. Admission 10c, including lunch served during the evening.</p>
<p>Many houseplants were frozen during the past cold week, and the frost crept into a number of cellars.</p>
<p>Miss Margaret Reid was on board the train that was snow bound between Ithaca and Besemer, last Friday night. The train was three hours going from Ithaca to Brookton arriving sometime between 12 and 1 o’clock at night</p>
<p>J. L Mandeville passed a few days in Albany recently and his son Robert took the excursion train to New York city last week.</p>

<p>Lounsbery Hall was where the David Ireland Post of the Brookton G.A.R. was first organized:</p>

<p>THE VETS IN COUNCIL AT MOTT’S CORNERS.</p>
<p>The notice published in the JOURNAL of April 22, for a camp fire to be held at Lounsbery’s Hall, Motts’s Corners, brought out about thirty old veterans of the Town of Caroline and vicinity last Saturday evening. The meeting was called to order by Capt. W. V. Personius, and B. T. Landon was called to the chair. Capt. Lounsbery then stated that the object of the meeting was to organize a Post of the Grand Army of the Republic, whereupon twenty four comrades signed the roll and a Post will be organized next Saturday evening, providing a charter can be obtained from Department Headquarters in time. About this time several comrades from Sydney Post, of Ithaca, put in an appearance, when the boys gave themselves up to a general good time.</p>
<p>Comrade Joe Lindsley, introduced one of Hibbard’s autophones and played some very sweet music, after which the boys joined in singing &ldquo;Marching through Georgia.&rdquo; Rations were now announced to which the boys all did ample justice. After the pork-and beans had been demolished, the boys returned to the hall, where a rattling fire of songs, stories and reminiscences were kept up until 12 o’clock, when the camp broke up, every comrade present, however, feeling that he had had a good time.</p>
<p>A cordial invitation is extended to all honorably discharged soldiers and sailors in the vicinity of Mott’s Corners: to send in their names and discharge papers next Saturday evening, and join in establishing a Post of G.A.R.</p>

<p><em>A Drive-by Tour of the Town of Caroline</em> sponsored by the Town of Caroline Bicentennial Committee 1994-1995, contains a listing for M. E. Mills on a page identified as “Tour 4 - P7” in a 2016 reprint by The White Church Cabin Country Store and appears to be the source (with some alterations) of the description Molly Adams used in her “Note”. In Molly’s research notes, she gives the attribution: “[Driveby, ie Conant]&quot; and I have confirmed with Barbara Kone that Gertrude wrote the Brooktondale portions of the &ldquo;Drive-by&rdquo; book:</p>
<blockquote class="quote-only">
<p><strong>BROOKTONDALE POST OFFICE, left -- 484 Brooktondale Road</strong>
</p>
<p>This was Miss Mary Emily Mills&rsquo;(1861-1937) Dry Goods Store. She also had kerosene, Kerosene lamps with green shades, penny candy, stockings, handkerchiefs, yard goods, pins &amp; sewing notions sheets &amp; pillowcases, groceries, etc. She was a &ldquo;sweet little lady&rdquo; who succeeded her father in the business. Jessie Brewer had dry goods here after Miss Mills, and also had a lending library in the back.</p>
<p>The post office has moved at least 3 times. This is the 3rd site.Between the Post Office and the bridge sat the Shurter House which was moved.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(I tried to faithfully reproduce the punctuation, capitalization, spacing, etc. of the source.)</p>
<p>And Molly Adams, in A Note on Emily Mills tells of Emily&rsquo;s initial marketing attempts on her own:</p>
<blockquote class="quote-only">
Before David VanDeMark’s mother Grace died, he had found in her sewing machine (which had been acquired from Clara Lockwood) a little leatherette booklet labeled on the outside “M. E. MILLS, DEALER IN DRY GOODS, GROCERIES, HARDWARE AND CROCKERY, BROOKTON, N.Y.” On the inside is a calendar covering July 1909 to July 1910, a pack of needles and a fabric needle holder. The text says "This is a complete set of needles for all purposes. All the best imported. We would very much appreciate your patronage when anything in our line is needed.”
</blockquote>
<p>We know a great deal about Emily through the activities of M. E. Mills, which Emily made a community focal point as a natural consequence of her many interests and activities, and intentional or not, had to have been excellent marketing for her store. (My impressions are that Emily took a great deal of pride in the running of her store and took its effective management very seriously and did indeed consider every opportunity to volunteer her store for free press and increased foot traffic, such as the regular millinery exhibits by Margaret LaBar.)</p>

Her name has several variations in spelling. In relation to the Mills’ store, it is consistently spelled “La Barre” however, Margaret did many similar store displays in which her name is consisently spelled “LaBarr”. The same is true of many of her mentions in the Danby gossip columns, where both “LaBarr” and “LaBar” are used. “LaBarr” is used in Margaret’s own notices and advertisements: she advertised the sale of millinery supplies from her home in Danby, and she also owned a home that she rented.

<p>Although I have only had limited access to the Mills&rsquo; store journals&ndash;and therefore cannot claim to have reviewed them carefully or completely&ndash;I do not recall ever seeing expenses for leasing the Mills store space. While most of the business expenses in the journals are understandably for inventory, many other types of business expenses are also recorded there. Perhaps payment was on a longer schedule and I simply didn&rsquo;t see the entries.</p>

<p>Identical notices for the Halloween party ran in The Ithaca Journal on 28 Oct and 29 Oct 1935.</p>
<p>And in the following, Molly Adams seems to indicate &ldquo;at the store&rdquo; refers to what is presently known as Brookton&rsquo;s Market, owned by Robert (Bob) Tucker at that time, and not M. E. Mills, although her choice of words is noticeably vague on the point. Presumably, I can find the original quote and get a better sense of this, but it&rsquo;s not obvious this isn&rsquo;t referring to Mills&rsquo; store:</p>

<blockquote>
...At Old Home Day in 1935 Professor Edwin Shurter proposed a memorial to Dr. Lockwood: those who wished to contribute could sign up "at the store." This store in the center of town, with the post office attached, had become, and remains, a village hub.

<p>The movement to honor the man who &ldquo;combined in himself the functions of minister, physician, lawyer, counsellor and friend,&rdquo; was initiated by the Caroline Town Council. For 26 years, in the words of one Caroline resident, Doctor Lockwood &ldquo;day after day drove over the dusty roads of summer and through the snow banks of winter, answered calls by day or night, visited patients on sick beds and death beds, and ministered to the ailments of hundreds in the Town of Caroline who survive him and hold him in grateful remembrance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The tablet bears the following inscription:</p>
<hr>
<p>Dr. BENJAMIN F. LOCKWOOD</p>
<p>(1862-1934)</p>
<p>In grateful appreciation of his faithful services during a period of twenty-six years to the people of the Town of Caroline.</p>

<li>Here, it seems that Emily was using an opportunity to publicize her store instead of &ldquo;M. Emily Mills&rdquo; or &ldquo;Emily Mills&rdquo; as she normally referred to herself. E. D. Shurter, Charles and Anna Mulks, as well as Jessie (Shurter) and Lewis Brewer are among those mentioned.</li>
<li>A close reading suggests that the &ldquo;Caroline resident&rdquo; quoted is E. D. Shurter, and in fact, the style of the entire article is uncharacteristic of a Journal reporter and reads more like a press release the Professor wrote for the Journal.</li>

<p>The memorial, presumably with the text provided by the professor, currently sits outside of Dalebrook Apartments, near the southwest corner of the structure, directly across the street from the former location of Mills&rsquo; store, and facing the former Lockwood residence. There is also a bronze sundial on top of the stone (not visible in the photo) that appears to have been attached along with the tablet.</p>

Jessie Brewer ran a dry goods store in Brooktondale, selling fabric, ribbon, greeting cards, and other items. She took it over from a woman who had managed a grocery store in the same building and used the proceeds from the store to increase the family income and help support her widowed [step-]mother. She was also active in the Caroline Valley Federated (now Community) Church.

1961, Postmaster Charles Vorhis bought Jessie Brewer's store and moved the post office across the street. This store had been Mr. Mills dry goods store and was carried on for thirty years after his death by his daughter Emily Mills, who carried kerosene, kerosene lamps with green shades, penny candy, stockings, handkerchiefs, yard goods, pins and sewing notions, sheets and pillowcases. Emily Mills died in 1937. Jessie Brewer, who grew up in the house next door as Jessie Shurter, kept a dry goods store here after Miss Mills and had a lending library in the back of the store. (The Shurter House, which sat between the post office and the bridge, was moved to 447 Brooktondale Road in 1964 when the road was improved.)

<p>Bea Raponi may be the last living person with first-hand memories of Emily and her store. She told me that enough time has passed that she doesn&rsquo;t believe she could identify Emily in photos. I invited her to write down anything about Emily she does remember and send it to me for inclusion with these materials.</p>
<p>03 Aug 2022, Frank Proto offered to let me look around Mills&rsquo; store building, which I had only been inside once prior. At this time, only a small space downstairs was used by Frank as an office, while the upstairs was an apartment, although it was unrented at the time.</p>
<p>Frank mentioned that he had removed the old linoleum flooring from the time of the Vorhis post-office, exposing the hardwood beneath. The antique metal ceiling was also added.</p>
<p>There are potentially artifacts from the time of Mills&rsquo; store in the building. There are a number of items that predate Vorhis&rsquo; ownership, including old wooden mailboxes that may have been used when Edward was postmaster. There are also old wooden boxes with food brands painted on them.</p>
<p>The basement is accessed from a door that opens in the floor. This door is near a large exterior door where deliveries were likely made. The basement floor is fine dirt.</p>
<p>Frank speculates that the upstairs rear room may have been used for masonic meetings, and pointed out that an interior door contained a large peep-hole.</p>
<p>Mills&rsquo; store is easily visible from most windows in most rooms of Mills&rsquo; Home.</p>

<p>There is only one other deed I have found associated with the Mills’ family, and it was a transaction that Emily helped facilitate between Willis Shurter and his wife Betsey:</p>

<p>Notice that these deeds include an affidavit from Dr. Lockwood.</p>
<p>I have searched both 1907 and 1908 deed books, for both Caroline and Danby, for the following names: Lounsbery, Lockwood, Mills, Mulks, Roe, Reid and Shurter, and  I have not found a deed that corresponds to this date or that explicitly describes a barn. Interestingly, there is a real estate transaction between Amanda Lounsbery and John Roe earlier in 1907, that is perhaps related to the barn rental:</p>

<p>Perhaps the purchase indicated was not by the Mills, but by Edward and Amanda Lounsbery, or possibly Jessie Shurter, and the Mills were providing a service on behalf of the barn owner , to collect and account for these transactions at a convenient existing business already frequented by community members.</p>
<p>Note in the survey maps below, the existence of a structure labeled &ldquo;Brewer Barn&rdquo;, at the rear of the Lockwood property and behind the Mulks and Lockwood barns, that may be the barn in question. A note indicates that &ldquo;Brewer uses this driveway by permit&rdquo;.</p>

<p>The circumstantial evidence strongly suggests that the Brewer Barn was &ldquo;Willis Shurter&rsquo;s Wagon Shop in Motts Corners&rdquo;.</p>
<p>In the description of the oldest deed for Mulks&rsquo;s Home at present day 478 Brooktondale Road that I have yet found, from 04 Jun 1870, Caroline Deeds 3, p181, Jacob Vandemark, Charles W. Personeus &amp; Marcie E. his wife to Jacob Vandemark, it states that the property begins &ldquo;in the center of the &lsquo;Creek Road&rsquo; and 113 links westerly from a line with the west side of Willis Shurter&rsquo;s Wagon Shop in Motts Corners&hellip;&rdquo; This description is repeated in the next transfer on 27 Nov 1889 (Deeds 135/113), and only in the next transfer on 22 Oct 1896 (Deeds 146, p481) does the description change to &ldquo;&hellip;what was <strong>formerly</strong> known as Willis Shurter&rsquo;s Wagon Shop in Motts Corners&hellip;&rdquo; (emphasis added).</p>
<p>The matching distance of 113 links indicated on Map A1, p16 shown above confirms that this describes the western edge of the &ldquo;lane&rdquo; between the Lockwood Residence at present-day 480 Brooktondale Road and the Mills&rsquo; Store structure. This &ldquo;lane&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Brewer Barn&rdquo; were always conveyed with the store lot until 11 Jun 1963, when Jesse Brewer transfers <strong>both the &ldquo;lane&rdquo; and the barn</strong> to Arthur and Dorothy Wells, at which point, they became part of the Lockwood Residence lot, and they remain so as I write this. This also  explains why the stairway to the second floor (Lounsbery Hall) of Mills’ Store, on the western side of the building, has since that time encroached onto the Lockwood lot.</p>
<p>Josiah Shurter is listed in the census as a &ldquo;wagon maker&rdquo; (1870) and in 1875 both he and son-in-law William Benton Wolcott share the occupation &ldquo;carriage maker&rdquo;.</p>

<p>It seems reasonable to assume that William Wolcott worked for his father-in-law and/or brother-in-law at some point, and that this work was in the Brewer Barn. Josiah&rsquo;s son Willis inherited his father&rsquo;s properties and business interests, apparently by the late 1860&rsquo;s, and the store property was eventually purchased by Willis&rsquo; and Bestey&rsquo;s daughter Jessie Brewer.</p>
<p>The Brewer Barn still exists as I write this, and in a conversation on 19 May 2023, Frank Proto told me that according to what he was told by Charles Vorhis many years ago: Jessie Brewer rented horses and carriages from this barn in the distant past.</p>

<p>In the Caroline History Room in Slaterville Springs, there are a set of similar looking general store sales journals that belong to the general store of Frank C. Vorhis that was in the same location as Brookton&rsquo;s Market today.</p>

<p>These volumes are leather bound, but with badly deteriorating covers, containing entries from the 1890&rsquo;s to the early 190X&rsquo;s. I could not find anything in the volumes themselves directly identifying the store these journals were for, but I only reviewed the books briefly. A note accompanying them indicated they were donated by Frank Proto, owner of the Mills&rsquo; store location at the time of this writing.</p>
<p>Given that Frank donated them, and that the style of record keeping is quite similar to known Mills sales journals, I initially hoped these might be earlier books of E. H. Mills&rsquo; general store. When asked for more information on their origin, Barbara Kone said they came from Frank&rsquo;s basement, and when pressed further for which basement, she said &ldquo;from the Mill&rdquo; meaning the basement of Dalebrook, also owned by Frank Proto at the time of this writing, and at the time of the sales journals in question, was owned by Frank C. Vorhis, who also owned a general store next door in the location that eventually became Frank F. Mulks general store, and presently, Brookton&rsquo;s Market. In a later conversation with Frank Proto, he confirmed that he donated these volumes on &ldquo;permanent loan&rdquo; to the Caroline History Room, and that they came from the basement of Dalebrook, when Frank purchased the property from Charles Vorhis.  According to the Brookton&rsquo;s Market 2011 Calendar, Frank Vorhis owned the store next door from the 1880&rsquo;s to its sale to the Mulks brothers in 1902, when it became known as Frank F. Mulks. That timeframe matches these journals, and it appears the prices used in the comparisons in the 2011 calendar came from these books.</p>
<p>My review led me to conclude there were possibly several different handwriting styles, and although I have not looked through the entries thoroughly, I spent a little time reviewing a random sampling of entries over several books and could not confidently identify any handwriting as Emily&rsquo;s, although occasionally I thought I might have seen an interesting similarity, I could not see that similarity consistently. Obviously a more careful examination should be done, but in the meantime, the weight of the evidence seems to favor these being the sales journals of Vorhis&rsquo; store.</p>
