It was the final year of Edward&rsquo;s life. He and his second wife Hannah had both been members of the Church for just over a decade at that point, and depending on Edward&rsquo;s health at that time, we can assume that he and Hannah would have been present for the ceremony that day.</p><p>Reverend Annis Ford Eastman returned to Brookton to officiate. The Reverend made history by becoming one of the first women ordained in a Congregational Church while she was pastor of Brookton Congregational Church (now Caroline Valley Community Church) from 1889 to 1891. The Reverend wrote of her time in Brookton, including an account of her ordination, in &ldquo;The Making of a Woman Minister&rdquo; in the book <em>Enjoyment of Living</em> by her son Max Eastman. The Church&rsquo;s historical records also include an account of her ordination, including the names of the members of the &ldquo;picked council&rdquo; she refers to in her account.</p><p>After Reverend Eastman left Brookton, she became a very prominent religious and literary figure in New York and beyond, lecturing widely and counting among her friends the Reverend Thomas Beecher, brother of Henry Ward Beecher and Harriet Beecher Stowe, and Mark Twain, for whom she wrote the eulogy for his funeral service in Elmira, but which had to be delivered by her husband due to the Reverend&rsquo;s declining health. The Reverend died in 1910, so this was one of her last return visits to Brookton. So, needless to say, her presence this day was planned well in advance by the Reverend, and it was a very significant honor that hints at a rich context to this event that we can only speculate upon now.</p><p>(Interestingly, Mark Twain made his last visit to Elmira that very week, attending the dedication of a new organ at Park Church in Elmira, Reverend Eastman&rsquo;s church, on 03 Apr 1907. Twain was interred in Woodlawn Cemetery Elmira almost exactly three years later.)</p><p>The scripture verse used in the sermon is cited carefully, and uniquely identifies it with the King James Version of the Bible. Therefore, we can know some of the exact words spoken that day by Reverend Ford Eastman:</p><figure class=quote-only><blockquote>Strive to enter in at the strait gate: for many, I say unto you, will seek to enter in, and shall not be able.</blockquote><figcaption>— <cite>Luke 13:24, King James Bible</cite></figcaption></figure><p>This event and its recording are unusual in several respects, and deserving of further investigation. The record itself is quite unique in the amount of detail compared to similar records elsewhere in the same book. The number of people being baptized in one event also seems unusual for a congregation that size (it seemed more typical to have a small handful of people baptized in a year, and to not necessarily be grouped together) and may be related to the other notable fact: that eleven of the fifteen people are unmarried women (and two others were first degree relatives of women in that group of eleven). Add to this, the fact that Reverend Annis Ford Eastman returned to officiate this event, and a rough outline of what was happening begins to suggest itself, along with the significance that the cited scripture had for the Reverend and these women.</p><p>The following is a summary of information about the participants.

During the Reverend&rsquo;s tenure, she also gave occasional public lectures at the Congregational Church. In the Reverend&rsquo;s account of her first visit to Brookton, one imagines that it is likely that Mary Ann, and possibly Emily too, were among those who &ldquo;waited in the dim light of the smoky kerosene lamps to speak to me.&rdquo; (From <em>Enjoyment of Living</em> by Max Eastman, pg 70.) And perhaps the referenced kerosene lamps had been purchased from Mills&rsquo; store.</p><p>This is Brookton Congregational Church as it would have looked on the day of the ceremony:</p><figure class=image style=max-width:800px><img src=/family-of-edward-hallock-mills/assets/images/1907-06-13-bcc_hu0567c451c3879cdf08edb7716c57e082_1374631_800x0_resize_q75_box.jpg width=800 height=1082 alt><figcaption><p>— <cite>13 Jun 1907.
