<h3><a href=/family-of-edward-hallock-mills/features/me-mills/>E. H. Mills and M. E. Mills General Stores</a></h3><div class=meta>
<time>Sunday 22 Jan 2023</time>
</div><div class=content><p>After moving to Mott&rsquo;s Corners in Mar 1879, Edward restarted his general store on his own, now simply called E. H. Mills. Both Jonas and Emily clerked at E. H. Mills. Emily took over the store after Edward&rsquo;s death and operated it under the name M. E. Mills from 1909 until her death in 1937. Soon thereafter, Jessie Brewer took over the store and ran it under her name for a dozen years, primarily as a notions store with a lending library in the back. In 1961, Charles Vorhis purchased the building and moved the post office there from what is presently known as Brookton&rsquo;s Market. The Mills&rsquo; store structure survives today and is located at 484 Brooktondale Road, better known to current residents as &ldquo;the old postoffice&rdquo;.</p><a href=/family-of-edward-hallock-mills/features/me-mills/ class=more-link>read more</a>

H. Mills & Co. &ldquo;cash store&rdquo; offering general merchandise and dry goods.

<h3><a href=/family-of-edward-hallock-mills/features/staten-island/>The Mills Family in Staten Island NY</a></h3><div class=meta>
<time>Sunday 22 Jan 2023</time>
</div><div class=content><p>Edward and Mary Ann began their marriage in Staten Island NY where they lived throughout the 1850&rsquo;s and where each Mills child was born. Here, Edward likely learned the grocery business from Mary Ann&rsquo;s brother, <a href=https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/199952123/charles-m-pine>Charles Mills Pine</a> (1812 to 08 Oct 1897), who eventually co-owned E. H. Mills & Co. in Corfu. Pine&rsquo;s general store was located in West New Brighton, also known as Factoryville, a neighborhood in the Staten Island town of Castleton, and was at different times known as C. M. Pine & Co., Pine Hillyer & Co., and C. M. Pine & Son. The Mills are members of the Reformed Dutch Church of Port Richmond, where Charles Pine was a longtime member of the church consistory.</p><a href=/family-of-edward-hallock-mills/features/staten-island/ class=more-link>read more</a>

<time>Sunday 22 Jan 2023</time>
</div><div class=content><p>The temperance movement was a significant cultural phenomenon of the mid 1800&rsquo;s to the early 1900&rsquo;s, and was particularly strong among the religious communities of upstate NY. There was significant overlap between members of the temperance movement and those supporting suffrage, and before that, abolition. Emily, Hannah and Ellen were all active in temperance.</p><a href=/family-of-edward-hallock-mills/features/temperance/ class=more-link>read more</a>

<h3><a href=/family-of-edward-hallock-mills/features/caroline-hallocks/>Hallocks in Caroline</a></h3><div class=meta>
<time>Sunday 22 Jan 2023</time>
</div><div class=content><p>Although there is likely no direct connection between the two families, it is interesting to note that there are a number of Hallocks in the Danby and Caroline area coinciding with the Mills&rsquo; time in the area. But obviously, if these Hallocks are related to Edward&rsquo;s mother, it would certainly suggest reasons why Edward chose to move the family to Mott&rsquo;s Corners.</p><a href=/family-of-edward-hallock-mills/features/caroline-hallocks/ class=more-link>read more</a>
