<p>The temperance movement was a significant cultural phenomenon of the mid 1800&rsquo;s to the early 1900&rsquo;s, and was particularly strong among the religious communities of upstate NY. There was significant overlap between members of the temperance movement and those supporting suffrage, and before that, abolition. Emily, Hannah and Ellen were all active in temperance.</p><p>Prior to the Mills moving to Mott&rsquo;s Corners, its unclear if Emily or anyone else in the family was involved in temperance.</p><figure class=quote-only>
<blockquote>
Temperance groups don't appear to be very strong here. The only mention I found was the "Royal Templars of Temperance" who began meeting in 1878. They didn't seem to be very powerful. No date was given as to when they ceased to exist.

There was at least briefly a Corfu lodge of the Good Templars, although I don&rsquo;t yet know if Emily was a member there. This lodge apparently disbanded prior to 1885.</p><div class=cols>

Lathrap (commonly cited as Latrhop), a nationally recognized temperance leader in the late 1800&rsquo;s. According to <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Torrans_Lathrap>Wikipedia</a>: &ldquo;Mary Torrans Lathrap née, Torrans; (pen name, Lena; April 25, 1838 - January 3, 1895), known as &ldquo;The Daniel Webster of Prohibition&rdquo;, was a 19th-century American poet, preacher, suffragist, and temperance reformer. For 20 years, she was identified with the progressive women of Michigan who had temperance, purity, and prohibition as their watchwords, and the white ribbon as their badge. A licensed preacher for the Methodist Episcopal Church (1871), she served as president of Michigan&rsquo;s Woman&rsquo;s Christian Temperance Union (1882), co-founded the state&rsquo;s suffrage organization (1870), and worked on the amendment campaign (1874). Lathrap died in 1895.&rdquo; Note the parallels to Annis Ford Eastman. This poem has been used often in obituaries since it was penned, either in part or in its entirety, and it was obviously a fitting tribute to Hannah&rsquo;s life.</li><li><a href=https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/98809451/charles-bogardus>Reverend Elder Charles Bogardus</a> (19 Nov 1843 to 12 Oct 1925). Reverend Bogardus was a Baptist minister residing in Brookton. &ldquo;For 20 or more years he was pastor of five churches visiting them once each month.&rdquo; (17 Oct 1925, The Ithaca Journal, Ithaca NY, p5.) &ldquo;He was one of the best known clergymen in this section and many couples now residing here, began their married life with his blessing. He was also called upon to officiate at many funerals. He was well-known as Elder Bogardus.&rdquo; (12 Oct 1925, The Ithaca Journal, Ithaca NY, p5.)</li><li>Notice that in the 1870 United States Federal Census, both Hannah and then husband Charles Eastman both have checks in the columns labelled &ldquo;Cannot read.&rdquo; and &ldquo;Cannot write.&rdquo;, although presumably inaccurate.</li></ul></div></aside></figure><div class=cols>
