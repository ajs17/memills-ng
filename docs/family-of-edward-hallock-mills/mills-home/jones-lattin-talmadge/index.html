<p>A compilation of information and photographs from the late 1960&rsquo;s to the mid 2000&rsquo;s, during the years the home was owned by C. Dalton and Clara B. Jones, then Larry and Janet Lattin, and then by Andrea Talmadge. Each set of owners did much to improve the home and property that is still evident presently.</p><blockquote>
<p>“I feel that my professional work here in Ithaca and elsewhere has given me the kind of experience necessary for making the Ithaca schools productive for all segments of the community.”</p><p>“When a student is disruptive something is troubling this person. He&rsquo;s saying, &lsquo;Look at me–I’m here, I count.’”</p></blockquote><p>I have been in contact with the previous three sets of owners, and with each, I have offered to publish with this material any memories of their time in the home that they were willing to share with me. I left it completely open as to what to write about, how much to write, and when to get the information to me. I will add any such information I receive from them in a timely manner.</p><p>It appears that Jessie and Lewis Brewer never lived in the Mills home, but rented it until it was purchased by the Jones family. Beginning with one of the photographs left behind by Andrea Talmadge:</p><figure class=image style=max-width:800px><img src=/family-of-edward-hallock-mills/assets/images/today/talmadge/1950s3-photo-only_hu06aed07b42995cf91a7ed73e5ba6880c_448614_800x0_resize_q75_box.jpg width=800 height=550 alt><figcaption><a class=origversion href=/family-of-edward-hallock-mills/assets/images/today/talmadge/1950s3-photo-only.jpg>View largest available size.</a></figcaption><aside></aside></figure><figure class=image style=max-width:500px><img src=/family-of-edward-hallock-mills/assets/images/today/talmadge/1950s1_hu302983db2b8ee2107e993dd5681b8dcc_1960751_500x0_resize_q75_box.jpg width=500 height=494 alt><blockquote><p>I used to live here when I was a child.

Dalton Jones, and his wife Clara Brown Jones on 12 Jul 1969 (Deeds 482, p528, Tompkins County Clerk, Ithaca NY.) The Jones family initially moved to the Ithaca area in 1966 to pursue graduate degrees at Cornell University.</p><p>Clarence Dalton Jones (06 Jul 1940, St. Louis MO) began his career as an industrial chemist before entering the field of education, and he was a research associate, lecturer and doctoral candidate at Cornell in 1969. C. Dalton was also active in the local community, volunteering for local organizations including Caroline Elementary School and running for the Ithaca School Board.</p><blockquote>
<p>
C. Dalton Jones, research associate and lecturer, received a bachelor's degree in psychology in 1962 at Rutgers University and a master's degree in experimental psychology from Tufts Universtiy in 1965. He is currently a doctoral candidate in child development at Cornell and has worked in education, particularly curriculum development in urban black schools.
</p><p>
His research and teaching interest, range from the study of competence in black children to psychological aspects of culture and political awareness in Afro Americans.

Dalton Jones, research associate and lecturer in black studies and psychology at the Africana Studies and Research Center, in response to a question Monday night in Statler Auditorium on the Cornell University campus.</p><p>Jones’ two hour lecture was part of the “Biology and Society” lecture series and the first of four speeches on black culture.</p><p>Asked if he thought the interest in African culture among blacks in the U.S. was a “cop-out,” Jones replied that on the contrary it was a “cop-in.”</p><p>He went on to explain that “it is not a matter of having to go to Africa, but realizing that we are Africans and that that land mass (Africa) is being gobbled up like this one (the U.S.) was.”</p><p>Jones said that opportunities were limited in finding a large and somewhat undeveloped land mass which still had the possibility of developing “human values and human communities.”</p><p>“We will continue to exist here, but we see very little opportunity to grow in an economy and society which cares very little about human life,” he said. “Things haven&rsquo;t gone quite so far in Africa or the Caribbean — as far as being oriented to growth and profit.” Several times in his lecture, Jones criticized the United States for being overly specialized, too interested in a growth economy and devoid of human communities.</p><p>He criticized the growth and profit orientation and the “super-technological” aspects of life in the United States saying that it has alienated the white technological worker as well as the black family.</p><p>Jones also emphasized that blacks must be given autonomy over their lives and the chance to build their own communities. “Until black communities begin to take control of certain life support functions which lead to a sense of control and responsibility, there will be disruptions such as happened in the late 1960s,” he said.</p><p>Jones’ lecture, on sociological and psychological problems facing blacks in this country, examined recent work in intelligence, self-concept and learning among blacks.</p><p>He said that black children learn to distinguish between the black family, the black community and the larger, surrounding white society. “Every black child knows and must be able to relate to these two different environments,” he said.</p><p>The general orientation of black people to the white environment is one of “powerlessness and low self-esteem," he said, while the orientation of black people to the black community is “purely social.”</p><p>He also criticized studies which show that black children have a negative self-image saying that until black children go to school, they have a positive self-image from those black people closest to them such as friends, mother or lover. “Only at age five do we begin to find so called academic problems,” he said.</p></blockquote><figcaption>

<blockquote>
<p>
Positions on educational philosophy and student discipline were highlighted as five Ithaca school board candidates faced 150 of their constituents in the Ithaca High School lecture hall Thursday night.
</p><p>
…C. Dalton Jones, a Cornell research associate in black studies and psychology who lives in Brooktondale, said Ithacans are fortunate to have a school district willing to "break with old habits" and offer alternative programs from which to choose. Study must be interesting and provide some "payoff" to students beyond the report card, he said. He suggested that parents can improve schools and save money by making furnishings and materials on such topics as local history.
</p><p>
When a student is disruptive "something is troubling this person," Jones said. "He's saying, 'Look at me–I’m here, I count’”. Special programs should be designed for alienated students, and rules should be made clear each fall instead of after trouble occurs.

The decision by the Board of Managers, then, is actually a decision to dignify the human circumstances into which a child is born and to respect the woman&rsquo;s assessment of her own emotional requisites during childbirth,</p><p>Since we must assume that all persons involved with the recent ruling are committed to all babies and all women likely to be served by Tompkins County Hospital, rather than a few, it is unfortunate that the previous prohibition of fathers in the delivery room will prove more just, because it applied to everyone, than the present ruling. Are all pregnant women served by the hospital married? Would all of those that are married choose to share labor and childbirth with their husbands?</p><p>As the present decision is written, only those women who are married to men with whom they share a supportive relationship have any choice in this matter and unless we are to answer the above questions affirmatively then the ruling “allowing fathers in the delivery room during childbirth” discriminates against unmarried women and unsatisfactorily married women.</p><p>Furthermore, if it is the case that a woman&rsquo;s emotional well-being during childbirth might affect her performance as a mother and that allowing her to be assisted by a loved one during this experience might positively influence her behavior, then not only many women, but their babies, too, will be deprived of a significant service offered by Tompkins Co. Hosp.</p><p>Clara B. Jones</p><p>475 Brooktondale Road</p></blockquote><figcaption>

J. Kilgore, president of the hospital&rsquo;s Medical Board.</p><p>The motion to allow fathers had been tabled since Feb. 15. Phil Allen, Board member, requested at that time that the matter be tabled.</p><p>An ad hoe committee to study the question had been set up prior to the tabling action. But the ad hoc committee had been split, 2-2, on the motion.</p><p>Last month, the ad hoc committee recommended to the Joint Conference (meeting of the Medical Board and the Board of Managers) that the motion be approved.</p><p>The ad hoc committee consisted of Managers chairman Col. Richard Comstock, Board member M. L. Garmise, Dr. Philip H. Besancon, and Dr. Richard Murray. At first, Garmise and Murray were for the motion; Besancon and Comstock were opposed.</p><p>The four gave their approval last month via signatures to the recommendation to the Joint Conference.</p><p>Garmise, Allen and Mrs. Helen Hoefer voted for the motion Monday night. Arthur Cleaveland was opposed.</p><p>Last December, the Board defeated the same proposal. Then, Comstock, Cleaveland and A. W. Chamberlain were opposed, and only Garmise was in favor. The Managers president votes only in ties.</p><p>The hospital&rsquo;s obstetrical-gynecological unit and the Medical Board gave their joint approval to the motion late last Fall, but it took eight months to get the Managers to approve it.</p><p>There is no definite date set for the start of the program.</p><p>“It will strictly be worked out by the obstetrical-gynecological unit at the hospital. The guidelines for ‘qualifying’ a father to be in the delivery room were made clear by Dr. Murray. The father will have gone through an authorized course of instruction, and will be properly gowned and prepared to be present in the delivery room,” said Col. Comstock, who Monday night presided over his first Board meeting, having just recently been elected following Cushing Murray&rsquo;s resignation.</p><p>Garmise said that Dr. Murray “did a considerable amount of work in getting the motion approved. He researched this thing thoroughly, and he deserves the credit for seeing it through.”</p><p>Murray has since left Ithaca. It is not known where he is relocating his practice.</p><p>Specific guidelines of educational requirements for husbands have been discussed already. When the gynecological-obstetrical unit approves one particular set of guidelines, then the program will be implemented.</p><p>There will be a $5 charge for the couple to be able to be together during childbirth. The husband will wear a cap and gown and shoe covers and will be seated by his wife&rsquo;s bed in the delivery room.</p><p>Also under the guidelines, the husband must leave the delivery room if he is asked to do so. He must also submit a written request to the hospital administrator and to the couple&rsquo;s private physician for permission to be with his wife at the time of delivery.</p><p>The ad hoc committee&rsquo;s report referred to several insurance companies, area hospitals and legal experts in the field of malpractice and the consensus saw no objections to approval of the motion.</p><p>The Tompkins County Childbirth Education Assn. was one group responsible for much effort in support of the motion. Ex CEA president Pat Parker said she was “very pleased” with the decision.</p><p>Under the agreement, the patient, and the physician in charge of the delivery, must come to an agreement in writing that will include “hold harmless” clauses and-or releases for Tompkins County Hospital.</p></blockquote><figcaption>

There appears to be a few years’ transition period as the family moved out of the area for a new life, and rented the home before finally selling it to the Lattins.</p><p>Lawrence E. and Janet L. Lattin purchased the home on 14 Nov 1979. 16 Aug 2022, I reached out to Larry and Janet by telephone, introducing myself for the first time and asking them about the history of the home.</p><p>Larry mentioned that he “gutted the house” and rewired much of it. He put on the rear addition as I know it, and added the basement steps. He also added the present tool shed, and as I write this, “Lattin” (or possibly &ldquo;Larry&rdquo;) is still just visible, etched into the floor immediately inside the entrance, while the cement was drying. It appears there might be more letters etched in this way, but at this point, it is too faded for me to distinguish.</p><figure class=image style=max-width:800px><img src=/family-of-edward-hallock-mills/assets/images/today/adams-photos/2022-12-13_14.51.12_hu1703424cfa24429f2a79e939ca7c21c3_1302719_800x0_resize_q75_box.jpg width=800 height=600 alt><figcaption><a class=origversion href=/family-of-edward-hallock-mills/assets/images/today/adams-photos/2022-12-13_14.51.12.jpg>View largest available size.</a></figcaption></figure><p>Larry also told a remarkable story. While replacing the front door, items stored in a space above the door fell out. The items included old medicine bottles, post cards, and what Larry described as “a Civil War belt”! Larry still has the belt, and he recalls that it identified the regiment, but could not recall the regiment number. He was going to find it again to let me know the number, to see if it matches William Benton Wolcott’s, and I need to follow up with him on this.</p><p>He gave the bottles to a collector, and he donated the post cards to the Caroline History Room. I consulted with Barbara Kone, and she said that if local people are identified in the postcards, they would be put in the respective family folders, but after a few hours of effort, I could not find any postcards in the History Room that are connected with any previous owner of the home.</p><figure class=image style=max-width:500px><img src=/family-of-edward-hallock-mills/assets/images/mills-home/1989-10-31-The-Ithaca-Journal-Ithaca-NY-p36_hu5a2318c1f93ef70a37b995392af388e8_27874_500x0_resize_q75_box.jpg width=500 height=211 alt><blockquote><p>Town board members</p><ul>

<p>
When I bought the house, the Lattins had added a one room shack lean-to off the kitchen. Janet Lattin ran a day-care and she had her husband install an all-glass wall so the kids could be out in the playroom and she could keep an eye on them.
</p><p>
When the main roof was replaced early on, I was told that the lean-to was causing damage to the house and should be torn down - (post tear-down photo attached). At that point, we decided to build a legit addition to the house and the sliding doors were moved to the patio side as exit doors. The solid panel of glass stayed.
</p><p>
I'm fairly certain that Larry Lattin rewired the entire house - but I could be wrong.

A key point in our negotiations happened when I reached out to Andrea directly, much to the chagrin of our real estate agents: I told her that I understood she had a deep emotional connection with the home, and I assured her that I would do my best to preserve her work and maintain her high standards. Andrea loved the home and the community very much and even years later, misses both greatly.</p><p>Over the years, I have reached out to Andrea several times with questions about the home, and she was always very willing to help. As part of these exchanges, I would also tell her about recent improvements I had made to the home, and generally share with her the state of the home and the neighborhood.</p><figure>
<blockquote>
<p>
Originally, the house was square more or less.
</p><p>
What is currently the dining room (or was for us) - was the kitchen. The sink seemed to have been in a couple of places: on the bathroom side of the room and the window side (we found holes in the floor when we tore up the carpeting)
</p><p>
The kitchen wall ended where the ceiling slope begins.
</p><p>
The chimney end of the living room - was the dining room. The dining and living room were divided by a wall - and there were French doors between them. In the dining room - against that wall were built-in cabinets. We left the brass latch piece when we renovated the living room.
</p><p>
At any rate, the back wall of the original house was demolished by the Lattins (I think they have moved back to Brooktondale - they know more about the changes they made to add the huge kitchen and master bedroom) and a back window space was left (over the kitchen sink) and the light switch used to control the light at the former back of the house.

There was a functioning drain in the floor - it went under the road...through the Andersson's field most likely, and into the creek. When the creek was flooded, it wouldn't drain...we feared the creek would end up in the basement.

I enjoyed sitting up on that platform, and I recall Mary Andersson remarking how she enjoyed looking out at the hillside from her home. Unfortunately, this was an area that was beyond my ability to successfully maintain. The structure of the steps relied upon untreated logs from the hill that eventually rotted away, allowing the soil erosion on the steep hill to take over. At one point in the early-mid 2010’s, a dead tree on the hill fell across the wooden platform and flower garden, severely damaging the platform and crushing a few rows of the stone steps.</p><div class=cols>
