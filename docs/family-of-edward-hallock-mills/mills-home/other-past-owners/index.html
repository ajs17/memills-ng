The roof and foundation of Dalebrook are what survives today of the grist mill structure.

Personius</a> (1840 to 02 Feb 1924). In 1868, Mills&rsquo; store deeds describe the lot as &ldquo;nearly on opposite side of the highway from Jacob Vandemark&rsquo;s Grist Mill&rdquo; (Caroline Deeds 1, p556), and in 1874 the phrase is changed to &ldquo;nearly on opposite side of the highway from Charles Personius&rsquo; Mills&rdquo; (Caroline Deeds 3, p234). In 1934: &ldquo;nearly opposite the mill formerly owned by Charles Personius, now occupied by the Lockwood apartment building&rdquo; (Deeds 235, p84). Of course, the Lockwood apartment building is Dalebrook. Jacob&rsquo;s exact role is unclear, but Charles was described elsewhere as a miller, and he is often referred to as the owner of the grist mill in later years, and when it is sold to A. Cameron Vorhis, the mill was called Personius Flouring Mills.</p><p>(Personius is sometimes spelled Person<strong>e</strong>us, but it seems that most often Person<strong>i</strong>us is used for Charles and Walker, so I have chosen to stick with that spelling unless quoting someone else.)</p><div class=cols><figure class=image style=max-width:350px><img src=/family-of-edward-hallock-mills/assets/images/mills-home/1873-12-22-The-Ithaca-Daily-Journal-Ithaca-NY-p4_hu8d8ab6550257572a5625d6ce55cfe3b9_68579_350x0_resize_box_3.png width=350 height=384 alt><blockquote><p>DIED.</p><p>…VANDEMARK—In Mott’s Corners, Monday, Dec. 15th, Jacob Vandemark, aged 71 years.</p><p>Mr. Vandemark has long been known in this vicinity as a man of unflinching integrity, and those who were more intimately acquainted with him loved and honored him for his kindness of heart and christian sympathy.</p><p>The poor will miss him, his neighbors will cherish his memory with tender regard, while the members of his own family will long mourn for him as the faithful guardian of their prosperity and happiness.— [Com.</p></blockquote><figcaption><p>— <cite>22 Dec 1873, Ithaca Daily Journal, Ithaca NY, p4, nyshistoricnewspapers.org. </cite><a class=origversion href=/family-of-edward-hallock-mills/assets/images/mills-home/1873-12-22-The-Ithaca-Daily-Journal-Ithaca-NY-p4.png>View largest available size.</a></figcaption><aside><div class=notes><ul></p><li><a href=https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/89241014/jacob-vandemark>Jacob Vandemark</a> (1802 to 15 Dec 1873).</li></ul></div></aside></figure><figure class=image style=max-width:350px><img src=/family-of-edward-hallock-mills/assets/images/mills-home/1874-01-12-The-Ithaca-Daily-Journal-Ithaca-NY-p4_hu00946498cad4ffa0b686644bbd4e802d_48391_350x0_resize_box_3.png width=350 height=256 alt><blockquote><p>CAROLINE.</p><p>Thomas Vandemark and others to Charles W.

E. Personius Drowns Herself in a Mill Race.</p><p>Mrs. M. E. Personius, wife of Charles W. Personius, of Mott’s Corners, committed suicide by drowning on Saturday afternoon last. The body was found in the mill race back of her house floating upon the face in less than two feet of water. She had removed her shoes and stockings and tied a rope to a tree and around her body so that she might not float away. These facts go to show that her self-destruction was premeditated. Coroner Brown was sent.for; he went up Saturday night, and held an inquest yesterday morning. The evidence given showed that deceased was deranged and had been for over a year, as she had previously attempted self destruction by poison, but had been frustrated. Mrs. Personius’ age was 27 years and 3 months. Her funeral was held to-day (Monday) at 2 o&rsquo;clock. We append an abstract of the testimony taken before the Coroner’s jury, which consisted of Cornelius Johnson, Simon Sawyer, Ch’s. W. Burt, Martin Besemer, W. Harrison Shurter, Geo. B. Vandemark, William Vandemark and Willis Shurter:</p><p>Charles W. Personius sworn—Am the husband of the deceased, Marshy E. Personius; occupation a miller; came to the House between 5 and 6 o&rsquo;clock Saturday evening; found no one in the house; searched it without finding my wife; went to Wm. Wolcott’s and inquired for her her, also to Almanzo Perry’s; neither had seen her; Mr. Perry came home with me to search for her; we went through the house again, and then went back to the mill race, when we found her lying in the water directly back of the house, about twenty rods from the mill. The water was from 18 inches to two feet in depth; the body was floating on the water held up by a rope, tied about her waist and fastened to a tree; I took hold of the rope and tried to pull her out but could not because the rope interfered; so I cut it and Mr. Perry and I pulled her out; then Mr. Bacon assisted in getting her into the house; our cries for help had attracted the attention of several neighbors, who came to the house; as my wife was found to be dead the coroner was sent for; there were no marks of violence on the body; I believe she committed suicide; have had fears since the early part of summer that she was not in her right mind, from remarks that she made and from her actions; she stated to me several times that she did not wish to live; said she &ldquo;wished she was dead;&rdquo; never heard her say so before this summer; she has opposed me in almost everything I have attempted or proposed for the last three or four months; this was one reason why I thought her insane; never became angry with her or opposed her, during these spells, knowing her condition; we have always lived happily during our married life until her derangement since which time my anxiety for her has greatly marred my happiness; on the 11th of October last she attempted suicide by taking laudanum; I found her in the garret in a stupor; two empty laudanum bottles were lying by her and an ounce bottle of belladonna, three fourths full; I endeavored to arouse her and after a time she informed me she had taken laudanum, and said it was all right; I assisted her down stairs; placed her in bed and sent for Dr. Besemer; it was about 12 o’clock at night; I had worked in the mill till 10 o&rsquo;clock, and when I came home supposed my wife had called at some of the neighbors to await my return from the mill; sat down and read the newspaper an hour; then became drowsy and went, to bed, but did not intend to go to sleep until she returned; but 1 did fall asleep and awoke in about an hour, when I was frightened at her continued absence; got up and searched the house, finding her as above stated. She was not in the habit of staying out late, but on this particular occasion she had asked me how late I was going to be in the mill; told her I did not know; at that time of year I was in the habit of grinding until 11 or 12
o&rsquo;clock; So I supposed she was was for my accustomed time to return. My wife’s health has been poor a year and a half; about 7 years ago she gave birth to a deformed child which lived ten months; in April, 1874, we took from the Orphan’s Home in Elmira, a crippled child 12 or 13 months old; we became much attached to it, but after 7 or 8 months, my wife’s health failing, she took the child back to the home; cannot say whether this was one cause of her insanity or not; she said the care of the child and her household duties were too much for her strength; my wife has a cousin living who is now deranged.</p><p>Mr. Almanzo A. Perry and Dr. Besemer gave testimony corroborating that of Mr. Personius.</p></blockquote><figcaption><p>— <cite>20 Dec 1875, Ithaca Daily Journal, Ithaca NY, p4, nyshistoricnewspapers.org. </cite><a class=origversion href=/family-of-edward-hallock-mills/assets/images/mills-home/1875-12-20-Ithaca-Daily-Journal-Ithaca-NY-p4.png>View largest available size.</a></figcaption><aside><div class=notes><ul></p><li><a href=https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/89238131/marcia-e-personius>Marcia E.

Reddish-brown in color and extremely bitter, laudanum contains several opium alkaloids, including morphine and codeine. Laudanum was historically used to treat a variety of conditions, but its principal use was as a pain medication and cough suppressant. By the 19th century, laudanum was used in many patent medicines to &ldquo;relieve pain &mldr; to produce sleep &mldr; to allay irritation &mldr; to check excessive secretions &mldr; to support the system &mldr; [and] as a soporific&rdquo;. The limited pharmacopoeia of the day meant that opium derivatives were among the most effective of available treatments, so laudanum was widely prescribed for ailments from colds to meningitis to cardiac diseases, in both adults and children. Laudanum was used during the yellow fever epidemic. Innumerable Victorian women were prescribed the drug for relief of menstrual cramps and vague aches. Nurses also spoon-fed laudanum to infants. The Romantic and Victorian eras were marked by the widespread use of laudanum in Europe and the United States. Mary Todd Lincoln, for example, the wife of the US president Abraham Lincoln, was a laudanum addict, as was the English poet Samuel Taylor Coleridge, who was famously interrupted in the middle of an opium-induced writing session of Kubla Khan by a &ldquo;person from Porlock&rdquo;. Initially a working class drug, laudanum was cheaper than a bottle of gin or wine, because it was treated as a medication for legal purposes and not taxed as an alcoholic beverage. Suicide by laudanum was not uncommon in the mid-19th century.&rdquo;</li><li>From <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garret>Wikipedia</a>: &ldquo;A garret is a habitable attic, a living space at the top of a house or larger residential building, traditionally, small, dismal, and cramped, with sloping ceilings. In the days before elevators this was the least prestigious position in a building, at the very top of the stairs.&rdquo;</li></ul></div></aside></figure><figure class=image style=max-width:500px><img src=/family-of-edward-hallock-mills/assets/images/mills-home/1889-04-26-Ithaca-Daily-Journal-Ithaca-NY-p3_hu7e12504ce77e197c9aedc1ad59219d03_118000_500x0_resize_box_3.png width=500 height=1368 alt><blockquote><p>BROOKTON.</p><p>A number from here attended Easter services in Ithaca last Sunday.</p><p>The Ladies’ Aid Society of the Baptist church will give a Washington party at the rink next Tuesday evening, April 30.</p><p>Cameron Vorhis was taken seriously ill last Saturday morning.

Davidson in his address of 17 Sep 1890 at the dedication of the Engineers&rsquo; monument:</p><figure><blockquote><p>The Fiftieth and Fifteenth Engineers were not unlike the rest of the Union volunteers, and it was but a short time before they became as proficient in the art of practical engineering as were the regulars. While the building of forts and intrenchments formed no small part of their duties, the laying and building of bridges across narrow and wide streams were of the greatest value to the army in its thousands of movements in the field. It was always the first on the ground to span the river with a good pontoon bridge, over which the army with its infantry, artillery and cavalry could and did pass over, dry shod and in perfect safety. Its services in this direction won the respect and admiration of the world. I believe I state a fact which cannot be truthfully controverted, that no army known to history was better served in its engineer department, than was the Army of the Potomac. It was not uncommon for us to build a bridge 300 feet in length in thirty minutes.</p><p>The greatest difficulty which the engineers experienced was in transporting the long heavy pontoon trains across the country. The Virginia mud and the thousand obstacles encountered while dragging pontoon trains over the country will never be forgotten by the boys who trained in the Engineer Brigade. It has been said that few, in comparison with the losses in other branches of the service, suffered from bullets in the Engineer Brigade; but, on account of the severe service required, more constitutions were wrecked in this than in any other branch of the service. But our exemption from Rebel bullets was not complete, and the mention of Fredericksburg will be a reminder of the first severe baptism of blood the brigade received. Our losses were greater on this occasion than at any time afterwards, because this experience fully demonstrated that pontoon bridges could not be laid in face of the enemy, especially when they were entirely under cover of their rifle pits and intrenchments, and thereafter the rule was to first clear the opposite banks from Rebel muskets.</p></blockquote><figcaption><cite>—1902, Final Report on the Battlefield of Gettysburg (New York at Gettysburg) by the New York Monuments Commission for the Battlefields of Gettysburg and Chattanooga.

From Molly Adams&rsquo; research notes in the Caroline History Room: &ldquo;Walker Personius was a Civil War veteran and the village postmaster in 1882. He seems to have been the owner of Mott&rsquo;s original store which he called Personius Hall. The building had a large meeting space on the second floor, with seats that folded down from the wall. Memorial Day (then called Decoration Day) processions always formed in front of that building (see photo) and perhaps the David Ireland Post of Civil War Veterans met in that building. It seems clear that the post office was still at 559 Brooktondale Road in 1882.&rdquo; I don&rsquo;t know what photo was being referenced in the preceding passage. From &ldquo;Tour 3 - P8&rdquo; in A Drive-by Tour of the Town of Caroline: &ldquo;1st Post Office & store, left &ndash; 559 Brooktondale Road. We think this building was built by Mr. Mott, who owned most of the land at that time. &mldr;The G.A.R. lined up here to march to the [Quick, presently Brookton] cemetery to put flowers on the graves. There was a tannery between this house and the next before 1853 owned by Silsbury & [Edward] Lounsbery.&rdquo; Walker Personius and Edward Lounsbery were also charter members of the Congregational Church of Mott&rsquo;s Corners, presently called Caroline Valley Community Church, and were instrumental in its formation. George Richardson, who appears to have worked for Edward Mills at a time when Edward was Postmaster, eventually started his own grocery business in &ldquo;the old Personius store&rdquo; starting May 1897.</li><li>The service descriptions that follow are all taken from the unit rosters of the respective regiments found on the New York State Military Museum and Veterans Research Center website, accessed Summer 2022.</li><li>(Likely) <a href=https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/31030925/j-w-finn>J.

He served faithfully and well for three years and was rising rapidly in his chosen profession, when disease and death overtook him at his post of duty, Oct. 31st, 1864, in the 24th year of his age. In the Ithaca Journal and Advertiser of Dec. 7, 1864, we find the following notice: “Died—On board of the U.S. Steamer “Pembina” off Brazos Island, Texas, on the 31st of October last, Asst. Engineer Joseph W. Sydney, U.S.N., only son of Edwin Syndey, Esq., of this village, aged 24 years.” The Post is said to be &ldquo;newly formed&rdquo; in Ithaca on Memorial Day in 1877, when a special ceremony was held by the Sydney Post at Joseph’s grave. (31 May 1877, Ithaca Daily Journal, Ithaca NY, p3.) The New York, U.S., Town Clerks&rsquo; Registers of Men Who Served in the Civil War, ca 1861-1865, indicates that Joseph was originally buried at Brazos, and according to his findagrave entry, his body was &ldquo;returned to Ithaca and buried 24 Jan 1866&rdquo;.</p></li><li><p>From <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marching_Through_Georgia>Wikipedia</a>: &ldquo;Marching Through Georgia&rdquo; (sometimes spelled as &ldquo;Marching Thru&rsquo; Georgia&rdquo; or &ldquo;Marching Thro Georgia&rdquo;) is a marching song written by Henry Clay Work at the end of the American Civil War in 1865. The title and lyrics of the song refer to U.S. Army major general William T. Sherman&rsquo;s &ldquo;March to the Sea&rdquo; to capture the Confederate city of Savannah, Georgia in late 1864. The song became widely popular with Union Army veterans after the American Civil War. The song, sung from the point of view of a Union soldier, tells of marching through Georgian territory, freeing slaves, meeting Southern Unionist men glad to once again see the U.S. flag, and punishing the Confederacy for their starting the war." The first verse of Marching Through Georgia:</p><blockquote><p>Bring the good old bugle, boys</p><p>We’ll sing another song</p><p>Sing it with a spirit that will</p><p>Start the world along</p><p>Sing it as we used to sing it</p><p>Fifty thousand strong</p><p>While we were marching through Georgia</p></blockquote></li><li><p>From <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autophone>Wikipedia</a>: &ldquo;The Autophone was an early type of organette, invented in 1878 by Henry Bishop Horton. One of the first table-top organettes to be mass-produced, it played music using punched cards to activate 22 reeds.&rdquo; <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organette>&mldr;</a> &ldquo;The Organette was a mechanical free-reed programmable (automatic) musical instrument first manufactured in the late 1870s by several companies such as John McTammany of Cambridge, Massachusetts, <strong>the Autophone Company of Ithaca, New York</strong>, the Automatic Organ Co of Boston, Massachusetts, E.P. Needham & Sons of New York City, J.M. Draper of Blackburn, England, Paul Ehrlich & Co. of Leipzig, Germany, and The Mechanical Orguinette Co. of New York, NY as well as other manufacturers worldwide. The organette (or orguinette) used rolls of perforated paper, perforated cardboard, perforated metal disks and wooden rollers (or &ldquo;cobs&rdquo;) on which the music was programmed.

Finch and the late H. F. Hibbard. The manner in which the idea of the autophone was suggested to Mr. Horton as related by him is quite interesting, and shows from what a small beginning the present important and profitable industry sprung.</p><p>In the fall of &lsquo;76 Mr. Horton while on his way home from the centennial exposition passed a day in New York. As he was walking along Broadway his attention was attracted by a mechanical toy in a store window, and although he was in a hurry he step in to examine it. The device represented a boy playing upon a harmonica. It was a crude affair, but it contained a principle which our inventor thought could be developed into a useful and desirable musical instrument. During his journey home from the metropolis he continually thought of the musical toy and before reaching Ithaca he hit upon the plan of producing notes by means of perforated paper passed over ordinary organ reeds. He experimented with models for months and after producing an autophone that would play any piece of music accurately he continued to improve upon the invention until the year that he and Mr. Hibbard began manufacturing the autophones in this village. The invention proved all that Mr. Horton had anticipated and to-day the company employs some seventy-five hands and has agents in all portions of the country.</p></blockquote><figcaption><p>— <cite>28 Feb 1883, Ithaca Daily Journal, Ithaca NY, p3, nyshistoricnewspapers.org. </cite><a class=origversion href=/family-of-edward-hallock-mills/assets/images/mills-home/1883-02-28-Ithaca-Daily-Journal-Ithaca-NY-p3.png>View largest available size.</a></figcaption><aside></aside></figure></p></div><p>The Post was written of often over the years in the Brookton news in The Ithaca Journal.

He was distinguished on that memorable field for coolness and bravery, receiving the commendations of his superior officers, including his division commander. He was promoted to a captaincy in the Fifteenth regiment regular infantry in August, 1861, and served about one year with his regiment, gaining many friends by his frank and genial manners and untiring devotion to his duties. In the summer of 1862 be received a leave of absence from his regiment during the war, to enable him to accept the colonelcy of the One Hundred and Thirty-seventh regiment New York Volunteers. He handled his regiment with the same skill and ease that he did a company, and brought them to a high standard of drill and efficiency. The steadiness and determination which enabled his command to storm successfully the rebel stronghold at Ressacca, under a most galling fire, were due to his rigid discipline and instruction. It was here that he received the wound which terminated in his death, after a short illness.

In the summer of 1862, he was named colonel of the new 137th New York Infantry, which saw its first combat at Chancellorsville in May 1863.</p><p>Two months later, on July 2, the 137th—part of Brig. Gen. George S. Greene’s 3rd Brigade, 12th Corps—found itself building entrenchments on Culp’s Hill on the Union right. As fighting raged on the left, it remained relatively quiet for Henry Slocum’s 12th Corps until about 6 p.m., when he was ordered to lend assistance to the threatened Union positions in the Peach Orchard, Wheatfield, and on Little Round Top.</p><p>As the 12th Corps departed, Confederate Maj. Gen. Edward Johnson’s Division in Lt. Gen. Richard Ewell’s Corps advanced on the vacated Union trenches. Only Greene’s all-New York brigade had been allowed to remain—1,424 men aligned from the summit of Culp’s Hill to Rock Creek. Johnson had 4,678 men, more than enough, and as the Rebels swarmed in, Greene attempted to occupy those trenches, too.</p><p>To Greene’s fortune, his largest regiment—the 423-man 137th New York—was on his right. Ireland’s men managed to reach trenches previously occupied by Brig. Gen. Thomas Kane’s 2nd Brigade just as the Confederates struck. Leading the attack on Greene’s right was Brig. Gen. George H. Steuart’s 2,100-man brigade.</p><p>With three Virginia regiments, the 1st Maryland Battalion, and elements of the 1st North Carolina Infantry on hand, Steuart soon learned that Greene’s right was unsupported. The 137th checked Steuart’s advance for a time, but when a Union regiment coming to Ireland’s assistance was driven off the field, the 137th was on its own. “At this time we were fired on heavily from three sides…,” Ireland recalled. “Here we lost severely in killed and wounded.”</p><p>Though virtually surrounded, Ireland was able to fall back to a traverse line that had been constructed earlier in the day, but he and his men quickly faced a renewed assault—the fighting at close quarters and desperate. Captain Joseph Gregg, Company I, was mortally wounded as his unit contested a threat with fixed bayonets. Again, the 137th somehow kept the Confederates at bay until help arrived. Its ability not to break against such unrelenting pressure, in fact, is one of Gettysburg’s unsung stories. Had the Federals on Culp’s Hill succumbed, the loss of this critical sector undoubtedly would have altered the battle’s outcome. (The 137th New York ironically suffered 137 casualties. It is interesting to note that the more famous bookend regiment, the 20th Maine on Little Round Top, endured the same percentage of loss—32.4 percent.)</p></blockquote><figcaption><cite>—<a href=https://www.historynet.com/12-forgotten-heroes-of-gettysburg/?f>12 Forgotten Heroes of Gettysburg</a>, historynet.com, attributed to Charles Fennell Guide #28, licensed in 1986.</cite></figcaption></figure><p>The importance of the 137th Regiment&rsquo;s defense of Culp&rsquo;s Hill is echoed elsewhere.</p><figure><blockquote>There has been an impression somewhat prevalent that Culp's Hill was a mere outpost, of little consequence in the battle of Gettysburg. In reality it was one of the most important points in the Union lines. As anyone can see, had Johnson succeeded in establishing his strong division along this ridge, almost directly in rear of Cemetery Hill, supported as he was by the other divisions of Ewell's Corps, comprising at least one-third of the entire Confederate army, Meade would have been forced to retreat; he would have been flanked from his position without the firing of a shot, and the road to Baltimore and Washington left open to the invader. Retreat at that time meant nothing less than rout, disaster and ruin to the Union army.</blockquote><figcaption><cite>—1902 Jan, Final Report of the Battlefield of Gettysburg, New York (State).

Wolcott of this city, who is serving at the front with Company K of the 18th U. S. Infantry. Private Wolcott has been in the-trenches in the American sector three times, occasions which he styles as “Kaiser Kanning Parties.” His letter follows:</p><p>“Co. K, 18th Infantry, Regulars,</p><p>“February 18, 1918.</p><p>“At a dilapidated little town somewhere in France.</p><p>“The Ithaca Journal:</p><p>“I have intended for some time past to drop you a few lines and tell you all that I am allowed by the ever vigilant censor. When I say a dilapidated town, I refer to one that is practically shot to pieces, and in danger of more to follow. While standing a few minutes this morning gazing upon what was once a beautiful little park (resembling Dewitt Park in the ‘biggest little city’) it dawned upon me that not a sign of a cat, dog or hen was in evidence. I immediately came to the conclusion that gas masks were not issued to that sort of creature. These French people are wonderful in their fine artistic ways, their patience, their bravery and after three years of terrible warfare one finds their gallant poilus with an ever ready smile. The soldiers are not alone in this gallantry, for the women of France are equally energetic in their endeavor to win the war. I have seen them work in fields, factories, and on trains. Everything is humming along in this country at a good speed, thereby proving their efficiency. The weather here is cool but not enough to cause suffering. We are well fed, well clothed, content and happy. I am sorry to hear of such reports, as have been circulated tn the States, in regard to the Y. M. C. A., the Red Cross and other fine organizations. It is false as far as we are concerned over here, for they sure are a comfort to us and a wonderful accommodation. Have had three ‘Kaiser Kanning’ trips so far and am ready for more, (resting at present). I would like to step over to the States for a few days. Just to see the progress that you people are making in the war. I suppose everybody and everything is active. Have been over here for eight months now, but all the French language I know is ‘Wee, wee,’ meaning ‘Yes, yes.’ Somehow it does not appeal to me strong moiselles (guess that’s spelled right) enough to acquire it. The mademoiselles (guess that’s is spelled right) are very, very scarce, but one is able to get lots of old men and women to chum with him. Well, give my regards to all the boys. I would answer all their letters, but of late my time has been fully occupied. Goodbye for this time, and a happy thought I&rsquo;ll send soaring to the ‘biggest little city,” aand the sweetest spot on earth.</p><p>“Yours, “EARL A. WOLCOTT,</p><p>“Co.

Wolcott who died in a hospital behind the lines on May, 13 last from injuries received from a German gas shell on May 3. The tidings came in a letter from a comrade who finding among Private Wolcott’s effects the address of a girl friend now living in Groton, sent her the news of Private Wolcott’s death. Private Wolcott who was 26 years of age and whose only near kinfolks live in Brookton, went to France last May with General Pershing in the First Regular Division.</p><p>It was not the first time that he had served his country in the military service. Before joining the army in 1915 he had a record of four years’ service in the navy.</p><p>While he was in the navy Private Wolcott went around the world with the fleet sent on a world cruise by President Roosevelt. When he returned here he told many interesting tales of his experiences and the time spent in China and Japan.</p><p>Private Wolcott was a bookbinder and was employed by J. Will Tree for several years, until war was declared against Germany, when he enlisted, choosing the infantry instead of the navy. One of the last statements he made before he left Ithaca was to the effect that if he didn’t get the Kaiser, he would die trying.</p><p>It is surmised that Private Wolcott received the mortal injury which ended his life—he was seriously burned by a gas shell—at Cantigny, the village which the First Division wrested from the Germans several weeks ago.</p><p>A week ago when news came that Private Charles E. Dempsey of Trumansburg was wounded on June 7 on the Marne it was thought that he was the first Tompkins County boy to be named by the casualty lists as wounded in France. And so he was, but only because Private Wolcott’s name was somehow omitted. It now develops that he sustained his mortal wound a full month earlier.</p><p>The letter from Private Wolcott&rsquo;s comrade announcing his death follows:</p><p>“Base Hospital, May 18, 1918. “Miss Theo Stevens—</p><p>“As a personal friend of Mr. Earl A. Wolcott I feel it my duty to inform you of his death, which came the 13th of this month. His death is a great shock to me and many other of his company. I have soldiered with him since December, 1915, on the Mexican border and here in France and found him to be true to his word, upright and manly in every respect. His death was caused by gas. Will you please inform his grandmother—Mrs. Aldrich, I believe, is her name.</p><p>“With all respect to you and Earl’s friends,</p><p>“I am,</p><p>“A FRIEND.”</p><p>The name of this “friend,” as appeared from the envelope was Private W. E. Wyatt, and it was doubtless he who furnished the address to a Red Cross nurse, whose touching account of Private Wolcott’s last hours was received a day or two later. It follows:</p><p><strong>Nurse’s Letter</strong></p><p>“Somewhere in France, 1918.”</p><p>“My dear Miss Stevens—</p><p>“One of the men in Mr. Wolcott’s regiment knew he has been writing you since he has been in France, and, as we cannot find his grandmother’s address, I am writing to tell you of his death and to ask you to write her if possible.</p><p>“He was seriously burned by a gas shell May 3, and was in a field hospital until Friday, May 11, when he was brought here. He developed pneumonia and died Sunday evening about 7 o’clock. He was pretty delirious most of the time he was here, but had moments of being rational. I was with him almost up to the last moment of this life and he told me he would give anything if he could go home. He said that several times, so I expect he died thinking of you people at home he cared about.</p><p>“This is a French hospital, but there are three of us American Red Cross nurses to take care of the American boys. It is awfully hard to see them suffer, but it’s great to be able to help them even a little. We had a military funeral for Mr. Wolcott and our boys marched to the grave. It was very impressive. The service was read in English by an A. R. C. (American Red Cross) chaplain, and meant much to all of us.</p><p>“I don’t know what he was to you, but he was a good friend anyhow, I am sure, and you will know without my telling you that he was brave and patient up to the very last, and the men in his regiment felt terrible to have him go. He seems to have had many friends among them. If you know his grandmother’s address and will write her this, we would appreciate it very much.</p><p>“With warmest sympathy to her and to you, believe me,</p><p>“Very sincerely yours,</p><p>“MARY P. M’CANDLISH.”</p><p>The grandmother whose address was thus sought in vain, but to whom the sad news was promptly forwarded by the recipient of these letters is his father’s mother, Mrs. George Aldrich, of Brookton, formerly Mrs. Wolcott, who brought Earl up from babyhood.</p><p>Born in California, he was orphaned by the death of his mother, and soon his father also was drowned off the California coast. A brother, George Fred Wolcott, and a grandfather; John Roe, both of Brookton, are his only other near kin in this country.</p><p>His grandfather Wolcott was a veteran of the Civil War, and the boy’s enthusiasms were always for soldiering. At 16 he enlisted in the navy and served till he was 20. Then for four years he settled down at Ithaca as a bookbinder in the employ of J. Will Tree, long making his home with the family of Elmer E. Stevens, whose daughter is the correspondent named above.</p><p>But the impulse to adventure was too strong in him, and after a summer in boat service on the Great Lakes he in October of 1915 enlisted in the regular army and spent the next two years on the Mexican border, till in May of 1917, with General Pershing he sailed for France. Readers of The Journal will not have forgotten the cheery Christmas greeting from him which was published in the issue of January 3d, or the gay letter of mid-February printed on March 13, in which he told of his experiences in the trenches. Already before the fatal injury he had twice been wounded in the shoulder, and twice disabled by gas.</p><p>And now at 27, he is gone. “True to his word,” “upright and manly,” “brave and patient to the last.” What soldier could ask better epitaph? “No bigger-hearted boy," says Mr. Tree, his old employer, “ever lived on earth.”</p></blockquote><figcaption><p>— <cite>24 Jun 1918, The Ithaca Journal, Ithaca NY, p3, newspapers.com. </cite><a class=origversion href=/family-of-edward-hallock-mills/assets/images/mills-home/1918-06-24-The-Ithaca-Journal-Ithaca-NY-p3.jpg>View largest available size.</a></figcaption><aside><div class=notes><ul></p><li><a href=https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/56100184/earl-a-wolcott>Earl A.

Some ten years ago, having purchased the Personius Flouring Mills at Brookton, he sold his North Spencer farm and removed to Brookton, where he has since resided, and where he built up a large business, from which business, however, he was compelled to retire a year or two ago on account of ill health, he being then succeeded by his two younger sons under the firm name of F.

K. and was very glad to get it and glad to hear that you had received my letter of November 10. But of course Mrs. Phillips let you know that I was all right. I am spending a seven days’ furlough in this place. Arrived here last night. Three of us are in our room and all have separate beds (Le Palace Hotel), the best hotel in town, hot and cold running water and bath, and it equals in rank among the finest I have ever seen. My expenses are all paid so it certainly is worth while. The scenery is magnificent. The resort is surrounded by the mountains, which are covered with snow and one can go out to towns in the country and take in the most wonderful scenery in the world. They could have knocked me down with a feather when I came in the place, as I thought while I was in the army I would never get to enjoy anything like this. They gave each of us a ticket that entitled us to bathe at a hot mineral bathing house.</p><p>I have never received the Christmas box yet. Presume it was sidetracked somewhere. Quite a few of the boys never got theirs. I am glad to hear Father is improving and hope he continues to do so. Wish he was here to enjoy some of these hot mineral baths. This place is about seven miles from the Spanish border, so I think I will have Spain down in my list of countries before returning home. Will try and send all the folks cards from here. There is a large beautiful dining room in this hotel, where we get the best of food, and also served in the best of style. I am going up the mountain tomorrow on a cog railway just to take in a little more scenery. I got a letter from Russell the same day I got yours, and I guess he is well and enjoying himself. I will close for now, hoping this finds you all well and that I will be with you soon.</p><p>With love to all,</p><p>WAGONER EDWARD C. VORHIS</p><p>Co. H, 308th Ammunition Train</p><p>Am, Ex.

After an outbreak of typhoid fever in Ithaca in 1903, the Board of Health investigated properties along Six Mile Creek in Brookton and Slaterville and reported on the number of manure piles, tanning vats, hoghouses, and privies that polluted the waters flowing to Ithaca.</blockquote><figcaption><cite>— Molly Adams, "Town of Caroline" in <em>The Towns of Tompkins County: From Podunk to the Magnetic Springs</em> edited by Jane Marsh Dieckmann, p60.</figcaption></figure><figure class=image style=max-width:800px><img src=/family-of-edward-hallock-mills/assets/images/mills-home/1904-05-31-Ithaca-Daily-News-Ithaca-NY_huef19ce8bda30129f756001bc145bbc88_5195013_800x300_fill_q75_box_top.jpg width=800 height=300 alt><blockquote><p>[Partial transcription.]</p><p>HEALTH BOARD AGAIN IN SESSION TO INQUIRE INTO CREEK WATERSHED</p><p>Witnesses Tell of Conditions Along the Stream Which are Very Dangerous to Welfare of City—Filth Contamination Flowing Water–The Investigation To Be Continued.</p><p>Adjourned meeting of the Board of Health of the City of Ithaca, held at the Council Chamber, April 19, 1904, at 7:30 o’clock p. m.</p><p>…The next place visited was in Brookton, Dr. Reed’s.

(<em>History of the Congregational Church, Brooktondale, New York.</em> Compiled and edited by Mrs. Amy Atwater on the occasion of The Centennial Celebration of the Caroline Valley Federated Church, Brooktondale, New York, June 16th, 1968.)

Genung & Son funeral home at Waterloo. He served as manager of that firm from 1903 until 1909.</p><p>During his association with Mr. Genung, Mr. Gilbert assisted the latter in the compilation of the first textbook on embalming, in the invention of instruments, and the founding of the first school of embalming.
