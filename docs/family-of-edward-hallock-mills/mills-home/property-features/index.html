<time datetime="Monday 29 May 2023" class=text-muted>Monday 29 May 2023</time></div><div class=content><p>This section explores various features of the Mills’ Home property, including the stone foundation and the “large oak tree”.</p><h2 id=the-stone-foundation>The Stone Foundation</h2><p>I have speculated elsewhere that William Benton Wolcott, a carpenter by trade, who was the first owner of record of Mills’ Home, may have had a direct hand in the construction of the dwelling (see <a href=/family-of-edward-hallock-mills/mills-home/other-past-owners/>Deeds and Ohter Past Owners</a>), and that Reverend Garrett Mandeville’s grandson John L. Mandeville may have initially surveyed the property after it was divided from the lower grist mill lot (see <a href=/family-of-edward-hallock-mills/mills-home/mill-race-bridge-barn/>The Mill Race Bridge and The Barn</a>).</p><p>Presumably, the stone foundation that sits under Mills’ Home as I write this is the same foundation built for William Wolcott, and if this is true, then its enduring stability over these many years is presumably the result of a skilled stone mason of William Wolcott’s time. I set out to try to learn this craftsman’s identity, and although I cannot say for certain who did the work, I think there are several likely candidates, and one in particular stands out.</p><p>The real estate listing I responded to indicated the home was built in 1865, and while I can’t verify this in anything else I have seen, this is probably a good guess, as this coincides with William Wolcott leaving the battlefields of the Civil War, mustering out a few weeks prior to the 1865 census, although the initial deed for the property, which bears his name, is not created until 1869.</p><p>Assuming the stone mason was more likely to have lived near the Wolcott Lot, I started with the 1865 New York State Census, looking for variations of “mason” and “stone mason”. Again, I can’t say for certain that every stone mason in the area is accounted for in the census, but several are identified:</p><figure class=table><table id=stone-masons><thead><tr><th data-sort=string>Name</th><th data-sort=int>Age given</th><th data-sort=string>Trade</th><th data-sort=string>Census location</th><th data-sort=int>Page seq</th><th data-sort=int>Page num</th><th data-sort=int>Line num</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-sort-value="Benjamin C.

If that is the case, I haven’t been able to connect these markings to other data available to me.</p></div></article></main><aside><div><div><h3>LATEST POSTS</h3></div><div><ul><li><a href=/family-of-edward-hallock-mills/mills-family/buffalo-mills/>The Mills of Buffalo</a></li><li><a href=/family-of-edward-hallock-mills/mills-edward-hallock-1819/>Edward Hallock Mills</a></li><li><a href=/family-of-edward-hallock-mills/mills-mary-ann-1819/>Mary Ann Mills</a></li><li><a href=/family-of-edward-hallock-mills/mills-jonas-e-1852/>Jonas Edward Mills</a></li><li><a href=/family-of-edward-hallock-mills/mills-horace-f-1854/>Horace Franklin Mills</a></li></ul></div></div></aside><footer><hr><p><span xmlns:dct=http://purl.org/dc/terms/ property="dct:title">The Family of Edward H.
