I really don't know anything about the building of 475, unfortunately.
</p><p>
Early on after moving there, I did have the unique and wonderful opportunity to meet an elderly man - Carl English who stopped by to chat while I was gardening.
</p><p>
I don't remember all of the info he shared....his family owned a dairy farm operation which included land that went from their home (large brick house at the corner of Quarry and Snyder Hill Rds) all the way down into Brooktondale.
</p><p>
As a young boy, he and his brother had been part of a work crew hired to fill in the creek / stream that ran from the mill pond (between you and the Dalebrook)...across B'dale Rd...through what's now an empty field between the Andersson's and the Todi's property....into Six Mile Creek. There was a bridge near 475 giving it the nickname "bridge's house" or something like that. This fill-in, while successful, resulted in fairly unstable land.

Gracie Van Demark (yes, as in Van Demark Rd) told me that B'dale Rd and Valley Rd were not connected as they are now. The large white house I mentioned used to be somewhere between the old post office building and the Brookton Market - it was moved in order to re-arrange the course of 6 Mile Creek as well as the roads.

State highway officials revealed this week that the home of Mrs. Jessie Brewer is to be raised as reconstruction of the road progresses. Many old trees and the side yard of Mrs. Brewer’s home have already fallen victim to road-building. In the foreground is the railing of a side porch on the three-story house in which Mrs. Brewer was born almost 85 years ago and in which she has always lived. Her plans for the future are undecided.</p></blockquote><figcaption>

<blockquote>
When the Brooktondale Fire Company celebrated its first twenty years in 1966, residents were smug about progress since the war. The village had a fire company, natural gas, cable television, consolidated schools, a community center, telephones with direct dialing (no toll to Ithaca!), and now was looking forward to getting a safer road for school buses. From 1962 to 1967, Route 330 through Brooktondale was upgraded, for the first time since 1914. The improvements were greater than anyone expected. The Route 79 intersection was totally changed, and the entire road from there to 76 Road was “modernized.” Whole avenues of maples were lost; the abandoned upper mill was subjected to a spectacular “practice burn” in the summer of 1964; the bridge in front of the store was reconfigured. The old Shurter House, which had survived several floods in its day, was bought for one dollar and moved to its present location at 447 Brooktondale Road. Those who objected to the “Rape of Valley Road” complained that the road went nowhere, because it ended at 76 Road.
