Mandeville may have initially surveyed the property after it was divided from the lower grist mill lot (see <a href>The Mill Race Bridge and The Barn</a>.</p><p>Mills’ Home sits on a stone foundation and its enduring stability over these many years is presumably the result of a skilled stone mason working for William Wolcott. I set out to try to learn this craftsman’s identity, and although I cannot say for certain who did the work, I think there are several likely candidates, and one in particular stands out.</p><p>The real estate listing I responded to indicated the home was built in 1865, and while I can’t verify this in anything else I have seen, this is probably a good guess, as this coincides with William Wolcott leaving the battlefields of the Civil War, mustering out a few weeks prior to the 1865 census, although the initial deed for the property, which bears his name, is not created until 1869.</p><p>Assuming the stone mason was more likely to have lived near the Wolcott Lot, I started with the 1865 New York State Census, looking for variations of “mason” and “stone mason”. Again, I can’t say for certain that every stone mason in the area is accounted for in the census, but several are identified:</p><figure class=table><table id=stone-masons><thead><tr><th data-sort=string>Name</th><th data-sort=int>Age given</th><th data-sort=string>Trade</th><th data-sort=string>Census location</th><th data-sort=int>Page seq</th><th data-sort=int>Page num</th><th data-sort=int>Line num</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-sort-value="Benjamin C.

All other stones will be set in reference to this stone, thus determining the position of the entire structure.</p></blockquote><figcaption><cite><p>— <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornerstone>Cornerstone</a>, Wikipedia.org.</p></cite></figcaption></figure><p>At some point in the past, a concrete floor was poured that may obscure the cornerstone. It may also be in the northeast corner of the basement nearest the bulkhead door, which is presently obscured by a stone platform.</p><p>One final, potential point of interest. On the exterior face of the foundation, in the front to the east of the main entrance, there is a stone that has always caught my attention because of markings on its face. These are perhaps natural, or the result of incidental strikes of a chisel, but my perception has always attempted to discern letters intentionally carved into the surface.</p><figure class=image style=max-width:800px><img src=/family-of-edward-hallock-mills/assets/images/adams-photos/foundation/2023-05-09_12.39.22-imp_hu5d7cf88175262186b3e5023212e2ba49_3070034_800x0_resize_q75_box.jpg width=800 height=543 alt><figcaption><p>— <cite>09 May 2023, Adam Smith. </cite><a class=origversion href=/family-of-edward-hallock-mills/assets/images/adams-photos/foundation/2023-05-09_12.39.22-imp.jpg>View largest available size.</a></figcaption><aside><div class=notes><ul></p><li>stone foundation at mills&rsquo; home, exterior front wall, east of front door.</li></ul></div></aside></figure><figure class=image style=max-width:800px><img src=/family-of-edward-hallock-mills/assets/images/adams-photos/foundation/2023-06-11_19.21.34-imp_hu5972f4531b61a99bed19854009474c7b_1307476_800x0_resize_q75_box.jpg width=800 height=244 alt><figcaption><p>— <cite>11 Jun 2023, Adam Smith. </cite><a class=origversion href=/family-of-edward-hallock-mills/assets/images/adams-photos/foundation/2023-06-11_19.21.34-imp.jpg>View largest available size.</a></figcaption><aside><div class=notes><ul></p><li>Stone foundation at Mills&rsquo; Home, exterior front wall, east of front door.</li></ul></div></aside></figure><figure class=image style=max-width:800px><img src=/family-of-edward-hallock-mills/assets/images/adams-photos/foundation/2023-05-09_12.39.22-gray-con_huf8498eab35ecef69b7a2f4ccf1fa2d16_771384_800x0_resize_q75_box.jpg width=800 height=231 alt><figcaption><p>— <cite>09 May 2023, Adam Smith. </cite><a class=origversion href=/family-of-edward-hallock-mills/assets/images/adams-photos/foundation/2023-05-09_12.39.22-gray-con.jpg>View largest available size.</a></figcaption><aside><div class=notes><ul></p><li>Stone foundation at Mills&rsquo; Home, exterior front wall, east of front door.</li></ul></div></aside></figure><figure class=image style=max-width:800px><img src=/family-of-edward-hallock-mills/assets/images/adams-photos/foundation/2023-06-11_19.21.34-imp-gray-inv_hua6f00f05f58786502dfd3435910b62b3_4395731_800x0_resize_q75_box.jpg width=800 height=243 alt><figcaption><p>— <cite>11 Jun 2023, Adam Smith. </cite><a class=origversion href=/family-of-edward-hallock-mills/assets/images/adams-photos/foundation/2023-06-11_19.21.34-imp-gray-inv.jpg>View largest available size.</a></figcaption></figure></p><h2 id=the-large-oak-tree>The Large Oak Tree</h2><div class=cols><figure class=image style=max-width:200px><img src=/family-of-edward-hallock-mills/assets/images/brookton/maps/475-brookton/oak-miller_hu416851090eb82e0f39dfc0d603e4c8dc_59538_200x0_resize_q75_box.jpg width=200 height=185 alt><figcaption><p>— <cite>07 Apr 1972, Survey of 487 Brooktondale Road, Brooktondale NY by Thomas Miller, Book 1970, p11, Tompkins County Clerk, Ithaca NY.
