<time datetime="Monday 01 Jan 0001" class=text-muted>Monday 01 Jan 0001</time></div><div class=content><p>In the 1860&rsquo;s, when Brooktondale was called Mott&rsquo;s Corners, and Brooktondale Road was called Creek Road, the Personius Flouring Mills stood where Dalebrook apartments sit presently, almost directly across the street from Mills&rsquo; Store, better known to many today as &ldquo;The Old Postoffice&rdquo;. The Mills&rsquo; Home parcel was sub-divided from the grist mill property, and it was originally referred to as &ldquo;the Wolcott lot&rdquo; for William Benton Wolcott, the first owner of record. The mill race bridge is one of the primary landmarks used to establish the place of beginning for the Mills&rsquo; Home parcel from the time of its original sub-division from the grist mill to the end of Emily Mills&rsquo; life.</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;As a young boy, [Carl English] and his brother had been part of a work crew hired to fill in the creek / stream that ran from the mill pond (between you and the Dalebrook)&mldr;across B&rsquo;dale Rd&mldr;through what&rsquo;s now an empty field between the Andersson&rsquo;s and the Todi&rsquo;s property&mldr;.into Six Mile Creek. There was a bridge near 475 giving it the nickname &ldquo;bridge&rsquo;s house&rdquo; or something like that. This fill-in, while successful, resulted in fairly unstable land.&rdquo;</p></blockquote><aside class=toc><h1>Jump To:</h1><nav id=TableOfContents><ul><li><a href=#1869-and-1883-as-magnetic-bearings>1869 and 1883 as Magnetic Bearings</a></li></ul></nav></aside><p>For a long time, I have wanted to know more about the location and size of this bridge, which is an interesting feature in itself, and obviously, its location is important to understanding the history of the property.</p><p>First, some background on the grist mill/Dalebrook property itself, beginning with the deed history during the relevant time period that will be discussed.</p><figure class=table id=mills-home-deeds><table><thead><tr><th>Book</th><th>Book num</th><th>Page num</th><th>Document date</th><th>Recorded date</th><th>Grantor</th><th>Grantee</th><th>Amount</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Caroline Deeds</td><td>2</td><td>510</td><td>1877-01-01</td><td>1877-01-02</td><td>Charles W.

Note that this line is solid like other measurement lines on the map, and it is not dashed like the property lines shown. Also, there is an apparently related line to the east of Mulk&rsquo;s store with the same label, which seems to show a measured distance of 818 feet from the edge of the bridge as it existed in 1912 to the similarly labelled line at the edge of the parking lot of Mulk’s Store/Brookton’s Market, and so perhaps this could be reasonably accurately measured today to be able to verify the mill race bridge position relative to the property boundary and dwelling on the Mills’ lot.</p><p>Therefore, it seems that <strong>the eastern boundary line is not represented on this map at all</strong>, and note further that 82 links is approximately 54 feet, which strikes me as an unjustifiably enormous span for half of the bridge over the mill tailrace, although according to the 1912 survey, the flow of the tailrace across the road course was angled to the west of a line perpendicular to the road, which would necessitate a larger bridge span. Furthermore, this means that <strong>the “center of the mill race bridge” at the center of creek road is off-center from the bridge edges on either side of the road</strong>. The following attempts to show the angled bridge span, according to the map’s depiction of the tailrace. The solid horizontal green lines depict the bridge guard rails, using as a guide, the northern rail already depicted. The bold red line estimates the center of the bridge at the center of Creek Road:</p><figure class=image style=max-width:800px><img src=/family-of-edward-hallock-mills/assets/images/brookton/maps/1912-highway-p2-lower-cropped-lines_huac1342c74025796ce6ef41a920f1ed15_629200_800x0_resize_q75_box.jpg width=800 height=345 alt><figcaption><p>— <cite>26 Feb 1912, Plans for Improving the Cooks Corners-Brookton: Slaterville Springs-Caroline County Highway, Instrument number BF033282-001, Sheet 5, Tompkins County Clerk, Ithaca NY.

Once these improvements were finished, Emily Mills, Hannah Mills, and Ellen Gould, would have exited the front of their home (labelled H) and essentially would have crossed Creek Road in a straight line from the front door, then turned left at the southwestern edge of the bridge guard rail, then crossed the indicated &ldquo;cement walk&rdquo; on the southern side of the road that must have been part of the bridge structure.</p><p>Another question I often wondered was where the Mills kept horses and carriage that they would presumably have owned. This 1912 highway map provides the only evidence of which I am aware that depicts a barn, indicated with a &ldquo;B&rdquo; on the map, that presumably was the structure that housed these.</p><figure class=image style=max-width:500px><img src=/family-of-edward-hallock-mills/assets/images/brookton/maps/1912-highway-barn-close_hu57cdffaa422b37c49fa727b43108de0f_18069_500x0_resize_q75_box.jpg width=500 height=508 alt><figcaption><p>— <cite>26 Feb 1912, Plans for Improving the Cooks Corners-Brookton: Slaterville Springs-Caroline County Highway, Instrument number BF033282-001, Sheet 5, Tompkins County Clerk, Ithaca NY.

A binding layer of stone dust (crushed stone from the original material) may form; it may also, after rolling, be covered with a cement or bituminous binder to keep dust and stones together. The method simplified what had been considered state-of-the-art at that point. &mldr;McAdam&rsquo;s renown is his effective and economical construction, which was a great improvement over the methods used by his generation. He emphasized that roads could be constructed for any kind of traffic, and he helped to alleviate the resentment travelers felt toward increasing traffic on the roads. His legacy lies in his advocacy of effective road maintenance and management. He advocated a central road authority with trained professional officials who could be paid a salary that would keep them from corruption. These professionals could give their entire time to these duties and be held responsible for their actions.&rdquo;</li></ul></aside></figure><figure class=image style=max-width:500px><img src=/family-of-edward-hallock-mills/assets/images/brookton/maps/surveys/brooktondale-waterbound-macadam_hub27a91f712433469f623ddf80a66e26b_1682391_500x0_resize_q75_box.jpg width=500 height=750 alt><figcaption><p>— <cite>17 Jun 1912, Proposal and Specifications for Building the Cook’s Corners Brookton, Slaterville Springs Highway in the County of Tompkins, Caroline, Tompkins County Clerk, Ithaca NY. </cite><a class=origversion href=/family-of-edward-hallock-mills/assets/images/brookton/maps/surveys/brooktondale-waterbound-macadam.jpg>View largest available size.</a></figcaption><aside><div class=notes><ul></p><li>According to <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macadam>Wikipedia.org</a>: &ldquo;McAdam&rsquo;s road building technology was applied to roads by other engineers. One of these engineers was Richard Edgeworth, who filled the gaps between the surface stones with a mixture of stone dust and water, providing a smoother surface for the increased traffic using the roads. This basic method of construction is sometimes known as water-bound macadam. Although this method required a great deal of manual labour, it resulted in a strong and free-draining pavement. Roads constructed in this manner were described as &ldquo;macadamized.&rdquo; &mldr;With the advent of motor vehicles, dust became a serious problem on macadam roads. The area of low air pressure created under fast-moving vehicles sucked dust from the road surface, creating dust clouds and a gradual unraveling of the road material. This problem was approached by spraying tar on the surface to create tar-bound macadam. In 1902 a Swiss doctor, Ernest Guglielminetti, came upon the idea of using tar from Monaco&rsquo;s gasworks for binding the dust. Later a mixture of coal tar and ironworks slag, patented by Edgar Purnell Hooley as tarmac, was introduced. A more durable road surface (modern mixed asphalt pavement) sometimes referred to in the U.S. as blacktop, was introduced in the 1920s. This pavement method mixed the aggregates into the asphalt with the binding material before they were laid. The macadam surface method laid the stone and sand aggregates on the road and then sprayed it with the binding material. While macadam roads have now been resurfaced in most developed countries, some are preserved along stretches of roads such as the United States&rsquo; National Road. Because of the historic use of macadam as a road surface, roads in some parts of the United States (such as parts of Pennsylvania) are often referred to as macadam, even though they might be made of asphalt or concrete. Similarly, the term &ldquo;tarmac&rdquo; is sometimes colloquially applied to asphalt roads or aircraft runways.

As a result, it is difficult to say very much about it, other than it supports Andrea Talmadge&rsquo;s conversation with Carl English. However, it is intriguing that it seems to indicate the mill race bridge was on the Dalebrook side of the common boundary as it is represented here. There is a non-zero chance that this could be true; if the 1869 and 1883 Mills&rsquo; Home deed descriptions are re-interpreted as magnetic bearing and re-drawn, the boundary line extend far into what is now considered to be the Dalebrook lot.

The Route 79 intersection was totally changed, and the entire road from there to 76 Road was “modernized.” Whole avenues of maples were lost; the abandoned upper mill was subjected to a spectacular “practice burn” in the summer of 1964; the bridge in front of the store was reconfigured. The old Shurter House, which had survived several floods in its day, was bought for one dollar and moved to its present location at 447 Brooktondale Road.

It is defined by point C, the iron pipe at the brow of the hill. Recalling that the magnetic declination in 1972 was 10° 29&rsquo; W, the following adjustments are made to convert the bearings to true north for purposes of comparison:</p><table><thead><tr><th>Step</th><th>Stated Course</th><th>True Course</th><th>Converted Distance</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>X</td><td>N 19° 59&rsquo; E 320 feet</td><td>N 9° 30&rsquo; E</td><td>4 chains 85 links</td></tr><tr><td>Y</td><td>S 10° 44&rsquo; W 292.05 feet</td><td>S 10° 44&rsquo; W</td><td>4 chains 43 links</td></tr><tr><td>Z</td><td>S 53° 33&rsquo; E</td><td>S 64° 2&rsquo; E</td><td>14 links (approx 9.5 feet, from Miller 1970/11)</td></tr></tbody></table><p>The bearing for step Y is not explicitly stated in the footnote, and the Rice map is both difficult to read, and also, as already proven, cannot be correct anyway, as the line it depicts as straight cannot be straight. Instead, I have borrowed Schlieder’s measurements of the same area that states the course in step Y is S 10° 43&rsquo; 36" W true, which I have rounded slightly to S 10° 44&rsquo; W for this purpose. I have also used Schlieder&rsquo;s distances for steps X and Y. Shlieder&rsquo;s measurement is equivalent to the 320 feet stated and also note that it is essentially equal to the 4 chains 83 links distance explicitly stated in steps 2 and 3 of the 1883 Mills’ Home deed description.</p><p>The difference between the two distances (X and Y) is approximately 25 feet, which is the stated distance between the &ldquo;center line of the highway&rdquo; and both the iron pipe set by Miller in 1972 and the &ldquo;highway monument&rdquo; (Deeds 499/981). And of course, as before, step Z will be further adjusted to S 64° 30&rsquo; E to properly align the road with the other surveys, and when mapped, roughly accounts for the 9.5 feet given by Miller.</p><figure class=image style=max-width:800px><img src=/family-of-edward-hallock-mills/assets/images/brookton/maps/surveys/t3_hu11d06ea28d323c4e17a0b31a63d6cab3_207430_800x0_resize_q75_box.jpg width=800 height=628 alt><figcaption><p>— <cite>27 Apr 1972, Charles C.
