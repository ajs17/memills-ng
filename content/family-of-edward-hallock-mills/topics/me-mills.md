After moving to Mott's Corners in Mar 1879, Edward restarted his general store on his own, now simply called E. H. Mills. Both Jonas and Emily clerked at E. H. Mills. Emily took over the store after Edward's death and operated it under the name M. E. Mills from 1909 until her death in 1937. Soon thereafter, Jessie Brewer took over the store and ran it under her name for a dozen years, primarily as a notions store with a lending library in the back. In 1961, Charles Vorhis purchased the building and moved the post office there from what is presently known as Brookton's Market. The Mills' store structure survives today and is located at 484 Brooktondale Road, better known to current residents as "the old postoffice".

Long-time community members call this building "the old post office" referring to when it was used as such after it was M. E. Mills and then Jessie Brewer's store. But the post office had also been in that building many years prior, moving there when Edward Mills became postmaster.

It appears [George H. Richardson](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/189275611/george-h-richardson) (May 1862 to 26 Feb 1938) was an employee of Edward's, as he is never identified as the official postmaster in the USPS records. George also appears to be yet another person who was mentored in the grocery business and eventually began his own store.

More details on [George Richardson]({{% ref "richardson-george" %}}).

It seems likely Mills' store was always in this building. The following are some of the earliest references to Mills' store, detailing misadventures that took place while Emily was known to be a "clerk" at the store:

I have seen perhaps more than a dozen volumes of sales journals and other financial record books that are in the possession of a local collector who told me he was contacted by Frank Proto at the time Frank took possession of the former Mills' store building, and he was given the opportunity to go through the basement of the building and preserve anything of historical value. 

{{% fig "me-mills/vol-41-spine" "800" /%}}

Interestingly, the oldest of the volumes, labeled "No. 41" is the most important as it shows the records of E. H. Mills in the days immediately preceding Edward's death. It seems Emily herself (or perhaps Jessie Brewer after her) did not preserve the books from her father's time running the store.

The "Mills Family a/c" pages show the Mills' business expenses, mostly paying for store inventory. In these earlier books, this information was at the end of the book, starting with the inside back cover and progressed toward the front over time, whereas retail sales, including what the family themselves took out of the store, were entered in the books in the normal order, starting from the front and working toward the back.

The Mills Family account in the months following Edward's death: 

{{% fig "me-mills/1908-03-04-sales-journal" "800" /%}}

The store was open on New Year's eve and New Year's day 1908, the day Edward died, and Emily was working on an otherwise typical day of business at the store:

As you can see, these books contain many easily recognizable names of former Brookton residents, along with a glimpse into their regular purchases. It is interesting to note the store was closed on Sundays, but open on Christmas day, if a bit slow:

And some examples of Emily's own entries in the sales logs. Essentially, this is a glimpse inside Emily and Hannah's pantry. Emily may have had a bit of a sweet tooth, as candy was one of the more common staples:

By 1920, her daily records looked much the same.

{{% fig "me-mills/1920-01-19-Sales-Journals-p233" "800" /%}}

In the 1920's, more sophisticated business records emerge, both new types of records kept as well as a more formal breakdown of the store's inventory expenditures. These journals contained sample pages and instructions that Emily may have used to teach herself these new methods. This is further indication of Emily's character and how much pride she took in ownership of her store that she was continually teaching herself new practices, even after decades of daily work in this occupation.

As Molly Adams wrote in her "Note", Emily began aggressively advertising the newly branded store in 1909. She advertised perhaps dozens of times in the Ithaca Daily Journal alongside the Vorhis Mill and the meat market that is attributed at one time to Clarence Wheeler, someone mentioned many times in the journals of George Jansen. The first such advertisement I could find was in the 29 Mar 1909 edition (exactly 30 years after the Mills moved to Motts Corners), and the last was on 30 Jun 1910. What follows are a sample of some of them, many of which were repeated for weeks at a time, and they provide a good sense of the diverse products offered in the small country store:

In the Ithaca Daily Journal, 26 Aug 1909, pg 5, in an article "Early History of Brookton Village" M. E. Mills is listed as a "present merchant".

Several descriptions of M. E. Mills exist, the most complete of which is Gertrude Conant's:

{{% fig "conant-gertrude-1" "800" /%}}

In one of the present-day photos of 484 Brooktondale Road, you can see the staircase on the side of building leading to the second floor, that Gertrude mentions.

*A Drive-by Tour of the Town of Caroline* sponsored by the Town of Caroline Bicentennial Committee 1994-1995, contains a listing for M. E. Mills on a page identified as “Tour 4 - P7” in a 2016 reprint by The White Church Cabin Country Store and appears to be the source (with some alterations) of the description Molly Adams used in her “Note”. In Molly’s research notes, she gives the attribution: “[Driveby, ie Conant]" and I have confirmed with Barbara Kone that Gertrude wrote the Brooktondale portions of the "Drive-by" book:

<blockquote class="quote-only">
<p><strong>BROOKTONDALE POST OFFICE, left -- 484 Brooktondale Road</strong>
</p>

This was Miss Mary Emily Mills'(1861-1937) Dry Goods Store. She also had kerosene, Kerosene lamps with green shades, penny candy, stockings, handkerchiefs, yard goods, pins & sewing notions sheets & pillowcases, groceries, etc. She was a "sweet little lady" who succeeded her father in the business. Jessie Brewer had dry goods here after Miss Mills, and also had a lending library in the back.

The post office has moved at least 3 times. This is the 3rd site.Between the Post Office and the bridge sat the Shurter House which was moved.
</blockquote>

(I tried to faithfully reproduce the punctuation, capitalization, spacing, etc. of the source.)

And Molly Adams, in A Note on Emily Mills tells of Emily's initial marketing attempts on her own:

<blockquote class="quote-only">
Before David VanDeMark’s mother Grace died, he had found in her sewing machine (which had been acquired from Clara Lockwood) a little leatherette booklet labeled on the outside “M. E. MILLS, DEALER IN DRY GOODS, GROCERIES, HARDWARE AND CROCKERY, BROOKTON, N.Y.” On the inside is a calendar covering July 1909 to July 1910, a pack of needles and a fabric needle holder. The text says "This is a complete set of needles for all purposes. All the best imported. We would very much appreciate your patronage when anything in our line is needed.”
</blockquote>

We know a great deal about Emily through the activities of M. E. Mills, which Emily made a community focal point as a natural consequence of her many interests and activities, and intentional or not, had to have been excellent marketing for her store. (My impressions are that Emily took a great deal of pride in the running of her store and took its effective management very seriously and did indeed consider every opportunity to volunteer her store for free press and increased foot traffic, such as the regular millinery exhibits by Margaret LaBar.)

[Libbie H. (Sanders) Peck](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/138388479/libbie-h-peck) (05 Nov 1857 to 04 Nov 1929) took over ownership of the Mills' store building upon the death of her sister [Amanda (Sanders) Lounsbery](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/89338794/amanda-lounsbery) (12 Oct 1842 to 13 Nov 1921).

Although I have only had limited access to the Mills' store journals--and therefore cannot claim to have reviewed them carefully or completely--I do not recall ever seeing expenses for leasing the Mills store space. While most of the business expenses in the journals are understandably for inventory, many other types of business expenses are also recorded there. Perhaps payment was on a longer schedule and I simply didn't see the entries.

Two articles in the 14 Jul 1934 (p3) and 20 Nov 1934 (p5) issues of The Ithaca Journal tell of $135 in cash being stolen from M. E. Mills while Emily "was at lunch." Despite the information being publicly available, I have chosen not to republish it here out of respect to any descendants of those accused.

Identical notices for the Halloween party ran in The Ithaca Journal on 28 Oct and 29 Oct 1935.

And in the following, Molly Adams seems to indicate "at the store" refers to what is presently known as Brookton's Market, owned by Robert (Bob) Tucker at that time, and not M. E. Mills, although her choice of words is noticeably vague on the point. Presumably, I can find the original quote and get a better sense of this, but it's not obvious this isn't referring to Mills' store:

<figure>
<blockquote>
...At Old Home Day in 1935 Professor Edwin Shurter proposed a memorial to Dr. Lockwood: those who wished to contribute could sign up "at the store." This store in the center of town, with the post office attached, had become, and remains, a village hub.

The memorial, presumably with the text provided by the professor, currently sits outside of Dalebrook Apartments, near the southwest corner of the structure, directly across the street from the former location of Mills' store, and facing the former Lockwood residence. There is also a bronze sundial on top of the stone (not visible in the photo) that appears to have been attached along with the tablet.

As noted in other histories, Jessie Brewer took over the store at the same location, running it under her name primarily as a notions store with a lending library in the back, but unlike Mills', Jessie Brewer did not carry groceries.

<blockquote>
Jessie Brewer ran a dry goods store in Brooktondale, selling fabric, ribbon, greeting cards, and other items. She took it over from a woman who had managed a grocery store in the same building and used the proceeds from the store to increase the family income and help support her widowed [step-]mother. She was also active in the Caroline Valley Federated (now Community) Church.

1961, Postmaster Charles Vorhis bought Jessie Brewer's store and moved the post office across the street. This store had been Mr. Mills dry goods store and was carried on for thirty years after his death by his daughter Emily Mills, who carried kerosene, kerosene lamps with green shades, penny candy, stockings, handkerchiefs, yard goods, pins and sewing notions, sheets and pillowcases. Emily Mills died in 1937. Jessie Brewer, who grew up in the house next door as Jessie Shurter, kept a dry goods store here after Miss Mills and had a lending library in the back of the store. (The Shurter House, which sat between the post office and the bridge, was moved to 447 Brooktondale Road in 1964 when the road was improved.)

Bea Raponi may be the last living person with first-hand memories of Emily and her store. She told me that enough time has passed that she doesn't believe she could identify Emily in photos. I invited her to write down anything about Emily she does remember and send it to me for inclusion with these materials.

03 Aug 2022, Frank Proto offered to let me look around Mills' store building, which I had only been inside once prior. At this time, only a small space downstairs was used by Frank as an office, while the upstairs was an apartment, although it was unrented at the time.

Frank mentioned that he had removed the old linoleum flooring from the time of the Vorhis post-office, exposing the hardwood beneath. The antique metal ceiling was also added.

There are potentially artifacts from the time of Mills' store in the building. There are a number of items that predate Vorhis' ownership, including old wooden mailboxes that may have been used when Edward was postmaster. There are also old wooden boxes with food brands painted on them.

The basement is accessed from a door that opens in the floor. This door is near a large exterior door where deliveries were likely made. The basement floor is fine dirt.

Frank speculates that the upstairs rear room may have been used for masonic meetings, and pointed out that an interior door contained a large peep-hole. 

## Notes for Future Researchers

A summary of some of the Mills' store deeds:

In the Caroline History Room in Slaterville Springs, there are a set of similar looking general store sales journals that belong to the general store of Frank C. Vorhis that was in the same location as Brookton's Market today.

These volumes are leather bound, but with badly deteriorating covers, containing entries from the 1890's to the early 190X's. I could not find anything in the volumes themselves directly identifying the store these journals were for, but I only reviewed the books briefly. A note accompanying them indicated they were donated by Frank Proto, owner of the Mills' store location at the time of this writing.  

Given that Frank donated them, and that the style of record keeping is quite similar to known Mills sales journals, I initially hoped these might be earlier books of E. H. Mills' general store. When asked for more information on their origin, Barbara Kone said they came from Frank's basement, and when pressed further for which basement, she said "from the Mill" meaning the basement of Dalebrook, also owned by Frank Proto at the time of this writing, and at the time of the sales journals in question, was owned by Frank C. Vorhis, who also owned a general store next door in the location that eventually became Frank F. Mulks general store, and presently, Brookton's Market. In a later conversation with Frank Proto, he confirmed that he donated these volumes on "permanent loan" to the Caroline History Room, and that they came from the basement of Dalebrook, when Frank purchased the property from Charles Vorhis.  According to the Brookton's Market 2011 Calendar, Frank Vorhis owned the store next door from the 1880's to its sale to the Mulks brothers in 1902, when it became known as Frank F. Mulks. That timeframe matches these journals, and it appears the prices used in the comparisons in the 2011 calendar came from these books. 

My review led me to conclude there were possibly several different handwriting styles, and although I have not looked through the entries thoroughly, I spent a little time reviewing a random sampling of entries over several books and could not confidently identify any handwriting as Emily's, although occasionally I thought I might have seen an interesting similarity, I could not see that similarity consistently. Obviously a more careful examination should be done, but in the meantime, the weight of the evidence seems to favor these being the sales journals of Vorhis' store.
