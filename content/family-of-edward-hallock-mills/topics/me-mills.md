After moving to Mott's Corners in Mar 1879, Edward restarted his general store on his own, now simply called E. H. Mills, where his surviving children Jonas and Emily clerked. Emily took over the store after Edward's death and operated it under the name M. E. Mills from 1909 until her death in 1937. Soon thereafter, Jessie Brewer took over the store and ran it under her name for a dozen years, primarily as a notions store with a lending library in the back. In 1961, Charles Vorhis purchased the building and moved the post office there from what is presently known as Brookton's Market. The Mills' store structure survives today and is located at 484 Brooktondale Road, better known to current residents as "The Old Post Office".

In the 1866 Photographic Atlas of Tompkins County by Stone & Stewart, a map of Mott's Corners shows a structure labeled "J. Shurter Store" in the same approximate location as Mills' Store.

[Josiah Shurter](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/100594864/josiah-shurter) (26 Apr 1815 to 05 Aug 1877) married [Jane (Shutt) Shurter](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/100594934/jane-shurter) (21 Nov 1825 to 23 Jun 1897). The land that starts just west of the lower bridge in Brooktondale and encompasses the area between the southern side of Brooktondale Road and Six Mile Creek, extending many acres westward, is referenced in the deed records of the Tompkins County Clerk as the Josiah Shurter Homestead. 

Although Josiah is not listed in the directory below the Stone & Stewart map, the first entry, "E. C. Marsh...Grocery and Provision Store" is almost certainly a reference to the J. Shurter Store. [Edward C. Marsh](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/28741041/edward-c-marsh) (23 Nov 1836 to 25 Jun 1907) is Josiah Shurter's son-in-law, and presumably Josiah's employee. As indicated in the 1865 New York State Census for Caroline, Edward and his wife Harriet (Shurter) Marsh were living in the home of Josiah Shurter. Both Josiah and Edward Marsh are identified as millers. 

{{% fig "me-mills/1865-06-26-NYS-census-caroline-p34" "800" /%}}

Also living with the Shurters at this time is another son-in-law, [William Benton Wolcott](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/100303590/william-benton-wolcott) (06 Oct 1832 to 25 Feb 1911) who married Josiah Shurter's daughter [Ellen A. (Shurter) Wolcott Aldrich](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/187990128/ellen-a-aldrich_wolcott) (07 Sep 1843 to 21 Apr 1928). William Wolcott was a [carriage maker]({{% relref "#the-brewer-barn" %}}) and likely worked for Josiah and/or Josiah's son [Willis Shurter](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/162159964/willis-shurter) (1840 to 17 Jan 1914). William Wolcott was also the first owner of record of [Mills' Home]({{% relref "other-past-owners" %}}). Edward Marsh, William Wolcott and Willis Shurter fought in the Civil War in the years immediately prior. 

Willis Shurter inherited much of his father Josiah's property and appeared to take over Josiah's businesses by the late 1860's. On 16 May 1868, "Willis Shurter and Jane Shurter his wife" sell the store property to [George E. Sanders](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/89338797/george-e-sanders) (16 Aug 1847 to 01 Nov 1889), and in the 1870 United States Federal Census for Caroline, Edward Marsh is a carpenter and George E. Sanders is listed in the census as "clerk in store" while George's father George T. Sanders is listed as a "dealer in dry goods & groceries (ret)".

Willis Shurter's first wife, identified as "Jane" in the store deeds, was [Mary Jane (German) Shurter](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/100597023/jennie-shurter) (1845 to 12 Mar 1872), who apparently commonly went by "Jennie". It is Willis Shurter's second wife [Betsey Alvira (Merrill) Shurter](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/99603648/betsey-a-shurter) (1847 to 04 Jul 1932), whom he married in 1876, who is the mother of [Jessie M. (Shurter) Brewer](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/99536961/jessie-m-brewer) (27 Jun 1881 to 16 Sep 1974).

On 12 Oct 1874, "George E. Sanders and Fannie his wife" ([Fannie (Webster) Sanders](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/89338798/fannie-sanders) (23 Nov 1847 to 10 Feb 1896)) sell the store property to Edward Lounsbery, although George continues to operate a store there for several years afterward, as evidenced by the following news item discussing the [Independent Order of Good Templars]({{% relref "temperance" %}}), of which George Sanders' family and Edward Lounsbery, along with Edward's wife Amanda, were members.

George E. Sanders' father, [George Townley Sanders](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/89338795/george-townley-sanders) (14 Nov 1818 to 04 May 1887), was a founding member of the [Congregational Church of Mott's Corners]({{% relref "founding-documents" %}}), as was his daughter [Amanda (Sanders) Lounsbery](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/89338794/amanda-lounsbery) (12 Oct 1842 to 13 Nov 1921) and her husband [Edward Lounsbery](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/89338793/edward-lounsbery) (11 Oct 1833 to 27 Nov 1904). Another daughter of George T. Sanders, [Libbie H. (Sanders) Peck](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/138388479/libbie-h-peck) (05 Nov 1857 to 04 Nov 1929), married [George Riley Peck](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/20462930/george-riley-peck) (14 May 1851 to 28 Nov 1916) in 1877. Edward Lounsbery and George Peck were both "dealers in hides" and operated a tannery, Lounsbery & Peck, next to Walker V. Personius' store at present-day 559 Brooktondale Road. 

Although I can't yet say for certain where George T. Sanders' grocery business was, I believe there is some circumstantial evidence to suggest that it was at 559 Brooktondale Road, for example: In the 1800's, it was common for local post offices to be located within a grocery store, with the owner as postmaster. There are several examples of this in Brooktondale alone, presumably including George T. Sanders who was appointed postmaster on 20 Jul 1861, and is replaced by Walker V. Personius on 16 Dec 1864, six months before George T. Sanders is recorded as "dealer in dry goods & groceries (ret)" in the 1865 New York State Census for Caroline. It is claimed that this was Mott's original store in Mott's Corners, and the location of the first post office.

Like Mills' and Mulks' Stores, Personius' had to contend with theft.

Presumably George E. Sanders worked for his father at that location before purchasing the J. Shurter Store lot. George E. Sanders' Store was apparently the immediate predecessor of E. H. Mills' general store, and the circumstantial evidence I have seen strongly suggests that Edward Mills began his store at the building then owned by Edward Lounsbery soon after, if not immediately upon, arriving at Mott’s Corners in March 1879. Consider the 1880 United States Federal Census for Caroline showing Edward is a "merchant" and his son Jonas is a "clerk in store", that store presumably E. H. Mills.

George E. Sanders went on to be a produce dealer. He and his parents died within a few years of each other.

Edward Marsh moved his family to Ithaca approximately 1883, and he eventually became a city constable.

Willis Shurter had "been an invalid a number of years" (15 Jan 1914, The Ithaca Journal, Ithaca NY, p9, newspapers.com).

Long-time community members call this building "The Old Post Office" referring to when it was used as such starting in 1961 under postmaster Charles Vorhis. But the post office had also been in that building many years prior, moving there when Edward Mills became postmaster.

It appears [George H. Richardson](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/189275611/george-h-richardson) (May 1862 to 26 Feb 1938) was an employee of Edward's, as he is never identified as the official postmaster in the USPS records. George also appears to be yet another person who was mentored in the grocery business and eventually began his own store.

<div class="cols">

A section of this site is devoted to [George Richardson]({{% ref "richardson-george" %}}). [Edward's page]({{% relref "mills-edward-hallock-1819" %}}) has more information on his time as postmaster, including examples of his postmark on envelopes from the time.  

The following are some of the earliest references to Mills' store, detailing misadventures that took place while Emily was known to be a "clerk" at the store:

{{% fig "1897-03-18-ithaca-daily-journal" "500" /%}}

The following shows that the Mills' store was involved in charity while Edward was alive:

{{% fig "1904-08-29-The-Ithaca-Daily-Journal-p6" "500" /%}}

I have seen perhaps more than a dozen volumes of sales journals and other financial record books that are in the possession of a local collector who told me he was contacted by Frank Proto at the time Frank took possession of the former Mills' store building, and he was given the opportunity to go through the basement of the building and preserve anything of historical value. 

{{% fig "me-mills/vol-41-spine" "800" /%}}

Interestingly, the oldest of the volumes, labeled "No. 41" is the most important as it shows the records of E. H. Mills in the days immediately preceding Edward's death. It seems Emily herself (or perhaps Jessie Brewer after her) did not preserve the books from her father's time running the store.

The "Mills Family a/c" pages show the Mills' business expenses, mostly paying for store inventory. In these earlier books, this information was at the end of the book, starting with the inside back cover and progressed toward the front over time, whereas retail sales, including what the family themselves took out of the store, were entered in the books in the normal order, starting from the front and working toward the back.

The Mills Family account in the months following Edward's death: 

{{% fig "me-mills/1908-03-04-sales-journal" "800" /%}}

The store was open on New Year's eve and New Year's day 1908, the day Edward died, and Emily was working on an otherwise typical day of business at the store:

{{% fig "me-mills/1908-01-01-sales-journal" "350" /%}}
</div>

As you can see, these books contain many easily recognizable names of former Brookton residents, along with a glimpse into their regular purchases. It is interesting to note the store was closed on Sundays, but open on Christmas day, if a bit slow:

{{% fig "me-mills/1908-12-25-sales-journal-p466" "800" /%}}

And some examples of Emily's own entries in the sales logs. Essentially, this is a glimpse inside Emily and Hannah's pantry. Emily may have had a bit of a sweet tooth, as candy was one of the more common staples:

<div class="cols">

By 1920, her daily records looked much the same.

{{% fig "me-mills/1920-01-19-Sales-Journals-p233" "800" /%}}

In the 1920's, more sophisticated business records emerge, both new types of records kept as well as a more formal breakdown of the store's inventory expenditures. These journals contained sample pages and instructions that Emily may have used to teach herself these new methods. This is further indication of Emily's character and how much pride she took in ownership of her store that she was continually teaching herself new practices, even after decades of daily work in this occupation.

As Molly Adams wrote in her "Note", Emily began aggressively advertising the newly branded store in 1909. She advertised perhaps dozens of times in the Ithaca Daily Journal alongside the Vorhis Mill and the meat market that is attributed at one time to Clarence Wheeler, someone mentioned many times in the journals of George Jansen. The first such advertisement I could find was in the 29 Mar 1909 edition (exactly 30 years after the Mills moved to Motts Corners), and the last was on 30 Jun 1910. What follows are a sample of some of them, many of which were repeated for weeks at a time, and they provide a good sense of the diverse products offered in the small country store:

In the Ithaca Daily Journal, 26 Aug 1909, pg 5, in an article "Early History of Brookton Village" M. E. Mills is listed as a "present merchant".

Several descriptions of M. E. Mills exist, the most complete of which is Gertrude Conant's:

{{% fig "conant-gertrude-1" "800" /%}}

In one of the present-day photos of 484 Brooktondale Road, you can see the staircase on the side of building leading to the second floor, that Gertrude mentions. The second floor was known as "Lounsbery Hall" for owner Edward Lounsbery, and various community groups including the David Ireland Post of the G.A.R., the Grange, and the [High Bridge Lodge]({{% relref "temperance" %}}) of the temperance group, the Good Templars, of which Edward and Amanda were leading members, were known to meet there. (George Richardson was also a member of the Good Templars, and he and Emily both acted in the locally produced play *The Colleen Bawn* at Lounsbery Hall as well as several other locations, for the benefit of the Templars.)

The following is the clearest proof of the location of Lounsbery Hall:

{{% fig "me-mills/1899-02-00-Ithaca-Daily-News-Ithaca-NY" "500" /%}}

Lounsbery Hall was where the David Ireland Post of the Brookton G.A.R. was first organized:

*A Drive-by Tour of the Town of Caroline* sponsored by the Town of Caroline Bicentennial Committee 1994-1995, contains a listing for M. E. Mills on a page identified as “Tour 4 - P7” in a 2016 reprint by The White Church Cabin Country Store and appears to be the source (with some alterations) of the description Molly Adams used in her “Note”. In Molly’s research notes, she gives the attribution: “[Driveby, ie Conant]" and I have confirmed with Barbara Kone that Gertrude wrote the Brooktondale portions of the "Drive-by" book:

<blockquote class="quote-only">
<p><strong>BROOKTONDALE POST OFFICE, left -- 484 Brooktondale Road</strong>
</p>

This was Miss Mary Emily Mills'(1861-1937) Dry Goods Store. She also had kerosene, Kerosene lamps with green shades, penny candy, stockings, handkerchiefs, yard goods, pins & sewing notions sheets & pillowcases, groceries, etc. She was a "sweet little lady" who succeeded her father in the business. Jessie Brewer had dry goods here after Miss Mills, and also had a lending library in the back.

The post office has moved at least 3 times. This is the 3rd site.Between the Post Office and the bridge sat the Shurter House which was moved.
</blockquote>

(I tried to faithfully reproduce the punctuation, capitalization, spacing, etc. of the source.)

And Molly Adams, in A Note on Emily Mills tells of Emily's initial marketing attempts on her own:

<blockquote class="quote-only">
Before David VanDeMark’s mother Grace died, he had found in her sewing machine (which had been acquired from Clara Lockwood) a little leatherette booklet labeled on the outside “M. E. MILLS, DEALER IN DRY GOODS, GROCERIES, HARDWARE AND CROCKERY, BROOKTON, N.Y.” On the inside is a calendar covering July 1909 to July 1910, a pack of needles and a fabric needle holder. The text says "This is a complete set of needles for all purposes. All the best imported. We would very much appreciate your patronage when anything in our line is needed.”
</blockquote>

We know a great deal about Emily through the activities of M. E. Mills, which Emily made a community focal point as a natural consequence of her many interests and activities, and intentional or not, had to have been excellent marketing for her store. (My impressions are that Emily took a great deal of pride in the running of her store and took its effective management very seriously and did indeed consider every opportunity to volunteer her store for free press and increased foot traffic, such as the regular millinery exhibits by Margaret LaBar.)

[Libbie H.

Although I have only had limited access to the Mills' store journals--and therefore cannot claim to have reviewed them carefully or completely--I do not recall ever seeing expenses for leasing the Mills store space. While most of the business expenses in the journals are understandably for inventory, many other types of business expenses are also recorded there. Perhaps payment was on a longer schedule and I simply didn't see the entries.

Shortly after Dr. Lockwood's death in 1934, his widow [Mittie A. (Peer) Lockwood](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/97943261/mittie-a-lockwood) (10 Nov 1863 to 11 Oct 1939) sold the property to Jessie Brewer, days before Mills' store was burglarized.

Two articles in the 14 Jul 1934 (p3) and 20 Nov 1934 (p5) issues of The Ithaca Journal tell of $135 in cash being stolen from M. E. Mills while Emily "was at lunch."

Identical notices for the Halloween party ran in The Ithaca Journal on 28 Oct and 29 Oct 1935.

And in the following, Molly Adams seems to indicate "at the store" refers to what is presently known as Brookton's Market, owned by Robert (Bob) Tucker at that time, and not M. E. Mills, although her choice of words is noticeably vague on the point. Presumably, I can find the original quote and get a better sense of this, but it's not obvious this isn't referring to Mills' store:

<blockquote>
...At Old Home Day in 1935 Professor Edwin Shurter proposed a memorial to Dr. Lockwood: those who wished to contribute could sign up "at the store." This store in the center of town, with the post office attached, had become, and remains, a village hub.

The memorial, presumably with the text provided by the professor, currently sits outside of Dalebrook Apartments, near the southwest corner of the structure, directly across the street from the former location of Mills' store, and facing the former Lockwood residence. There is also a bronze sundial on top of the stone (not visible in the photo) that appears to have been attached along with the tablet.

As noted in other histories, Jessie Brewer took over the store at the same location, running it under her name primarily as a notions store with a lending library in the back, but unlike Mills', Jessie Brewer did not carry groceries.

<blockquote>
Jessie Brewer ran a dry goods store in Brooktondale, selling fabric, ribbon, greeting cards, and other items. She took it over from a woman who had managed a grocery store in the same building and used the proceeds from the store to increase the family income and help support her widowed [step-]mother. She was also active in the Caroline Valley Federated (now Community) Church.

<blockquote>
1961, Postmaster Charles Vorhis bought Jessie Brewer's store and moved the post office across the street. This store had been Mr. Mills dry goods store and was carried on for thirty years after his death by his daughter Emily Mills, who carried kerosene, kerosene lamps with green shades, penny candy, stockings, handkerchiefs, yard goods, pins and sewing notions, sheets and pillowcases. Emily Mills died in 1937. Jessie Brewer, who grew up in the house next door as Jessie Shurter, kept a dry goods store here after Miss Mills and had a lending library in the back of the store. (The Shurter House, which sat between the post office and the bridge, was moved to 447 Brooktondale Road in 1964 when the road was improved.)

Bea Raponi may be the last living person with first-hand memories of Emily and her store. She told me that enough time has passed that she doesn't believe she could identify Emily in photos. I invited her to write down anything about Emily she does remember and send it to me for inclusion with these materials.

03 Aug 2022, Frank Proto offered to let me look around Mills' store building, which I had only been inside once prior. At this time, only a small space downstairs was used by Frank as an office, while the upstairs was an apartment, although it was unrented at the time.

Frank mentioned that he had removed the old linoleum flooring from the time of the Vorhis post-office, exposing the hardwood beneath. The antique metal ceiling was also added.

There are potentially artifacts from the time of Mills' store in the building. There are a number of items that predate Vorhis' ownership, including old wooden mailboxes that may have been used when Edward was postmaster. There are also old wooden boxes with food brands painted on them.

The basement is accessed from a door that opens in the floor. This door is near a large exterior door where deliveries were likely made. The basement floor is fine dirt.

Frank speculates that the upstairs rear room may have been used for masonic meetings, and pointed out that an interior door contained a large peep-hole. 

Mills' store is easily visible from most windows in most rooms of Mills' Home. 

## The Brewer Barn

The Mills' home is the only real estate that I can find official documentation for the Mills' owning in Tompkins County. Yet in the sales journals of [E. H. Mills]({{% ref "me-mills" %}}) general store in Brookton, the inside front cover of volume 41 indicates the purchase of a barn on 23 Sep 1907 that was rented to John Roe for $0.50 a month starting in 1908:

{{% fig "me-mills/1907-09-23-barn-rent" "800" /%}}

There was a barn on the Mills' home property at one time, but by 1907, it was on land owned by the Mills since they purchased the property from Edward and Amanda Lounsbery 05 Jan 1903 (Deeds 157, p593):

{{% fig "brookton/maps/1912-highway-bf033282-001-p2-lower-hb" "800" /%}}

There is only one other deed I have found associated with the Mills’ family, and it was a transaction that Emily helped facilitate between Willis Shurter and his wife Betsey:

{{% fig "mills-home/deeds-171-334" "350" /%}}
{{% fig "mills-home/deeds-171-335" "350" /%}}
</div>

Notice that these deeds include an affidavit from Dr. Lockwood.

I have searched both 1907 and 1908 deed books, for both Caroline and Danby, for the following names: Lounsbery, Lockwood, Mills, Mulks, Roe, Reid and Shurter, and  I have not found a deed that corresponds to this date or that explicitly describes a barn. Interestingly, there is a real estate transaction between Amanda Lounsbery and John Roe earlier in 1907, that is perhaps related to the barn rental: 

{{% fig "mills-home/deeds-164-253-lounsbery-roe" "800" /%}}

Perhaps the purchase indicated was not by the Mills, but by Edward and Amanda Lounsbery, or possibly Jessie Shurter, and the Mills were providing a service on behalf of the barn owner , to collect and account for these transactions at a convenient existing business already frequented by community members. 

Note in the survey maps below, the existence of a structure labeled "Brewer Barn", at the rear of the Lockwood property and behind the Mulks and Lockwood barns, that may be the barn in question. A note indicates that "Brewer uses this driveway by permit". 

{{% fig "brookton/maps/A-1-Book-p16-rotated" "800" /%}}
{{% fig "brookton/maps/BF127082-001-book-272-p322" "800" /%}}

The circumstantial evidence strongly suggests that the Brewer Barn was "Willis Shurter's Wagon Shop in Motts Corners".

In the description of the oldest deed for Mulks's Home at present day 478 Brooktondale Road that I have yet found, from 04 Jun 1870, Caroline Deeds 3, p181, Jacob Vandemark, Charles W. Personeus & Marcie E. his wife to Jacob Vandemark, it states that the property begins "in the center of the 'Creek Road' and 113 links westerly from a line with the west side of Willis Shurter's Wagon Shop in Motts Corners..." This description is repeated in the next transfer on 27 Nov 1889 (Deeds 135/113), and only in the next transfer on 22 Oct 1896 (Deeds 146, p481) does the description change to "...what was **formerly** known as Willis Shurter's Wagon Shop in Motts Corners..." (emphasis added). 

The matching distance of 113 links indicated on Map A1, p16 shown above confirms that this describes the western edge of the "lane" between the Lockwood Residence at present-day 480 Brooktondale Road and the Mills' Store structure. This "lane" and the "Brewer Barn" were always conveyed with the store lot until 11 Jun 1963, when Jesse Brewer transfers **both the "lane" and the barn** to Arthur and Dorothy Wells, at which point, they became part of the Lockwood Residence lot, and they remain so as I write this. This also  explains why the stairway to the second floor (Lounsbery Hall) of Mills’ Store, on the western side of the building, has since that time encroached onto the Lockwood lot. 

Josiah Shurter is listed in the census as a "wagon maker" (1870) and in 1875 both he and son-in-law William Benton Wolcott share the occupation "carriage maker".

It seems reasonable to assume that William Wolcott worked for his father-in-law and/or brother-in-law at some point, and that this work was in the Brewer Barn. Josiah's son Willis inherited his father's properties and business interests, apparently by the late 1860's, and the store property was eventually purchased by Willis' and Bestey's daughter Jessie Brewer.

The Brewer Barn still exists as I write this, and in a conversation on 19 May 2023, Frank Proto told me that according to what he was told by Charles Vorhis many years ago: Jessie Brewer rented horses and carriages from this barn in the distant past.

## Notes for Future Researchers

In the Caroline History Room in Slaterville Springs, there are a set of similar looking general store sales journals that belong to the general store of Frank C. Vorhis that was in the same location as Brookton's Market today.

<div class="cols">
{{% fig "me-mills/vorhis-sales-1" "350" /%}}
{{% fig "me-mills/vorhis-sales-2" "350" /%}} 
</div>

These volumes are leather bound, but with badly deteriorating covers, containing entries from the 1890's to the early 190X's. I could not find anything in the volumes themselves directly identifying the store these journals were for, but I only reviewed the books briefly. A note accompanying them indicated they were donated by Frank Proto, owner of the Mills' store location at the time of this writing.  

Given that Frank donated them, and that the style of record keeping is quite similar to known Mills sales journals, I initially hoped these might be earlier books of E. H. Mills' general store. When asked for more information on their origin, Barbara Kone said they came from Frank's basement, and when pressed further for which basement, she said "from the Mill" meaning the basement of Dalebrook, also owned by Frank Proto at the time of this writing, and at the time of the sales journals in question, was owned by Frank C. Vorhis, who also owned a general store next door in the location that eventually became Frank F. Mulks general store, and presently, Brookton's Market. In a later conversation with Frank Proto, he confirmed that he donated these volumes on "permanent loan" to the Caroline History Room, and that they came from the basement of Dalebrook, when Frank purchased the property from Charles Vorhis.  According to the Brookton's Market 2011 Calendar, Frank Vorhis owned the store next door from the 1880's to its sale to the Mulks brothers in 1902, when it became known as Frank F. Mulks. That timeframe matches these journals, and it appears the prices used in the comparisons in the 2011 calendar came from these books. 

My review led me to conclude there were possibly several different handwriting styles, and although I have not looked through the entries thoroughly, I spent a little time reviewing a random sampling of entries over several books and could not confidently identify any handwriting as Emily's, although occasionally I thought I might have seen an interesting similarity, I could not see that similarity consistently. Obviously a more careful examination should be done, but in the meantime, the weight of the evidence seems to favor these being the sales journals of Vorhis' store.
