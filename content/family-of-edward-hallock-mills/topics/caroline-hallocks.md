Although there is likely no direct connection between the two families, it is interesting to note that there are a number of Hallocks in the Danby and Caroline area coinciding with the Mills' time in the area. But obviously, if these Hallocks are related to Edward's mother, it would certainly suggest reasons why Edward chose to move the family to Mott's Corners.

Hallock](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/66471939/william-b-hallock) (07 Jul 1822 to 29 Mar 1901), a prominent farmer in Danby who is closely associated with Thomas H. Howell, of Howell Brothers general store, also in Danby. Intriguingly, Hallock and Howell would eventually partner on a dry goods store in Willseyville.
