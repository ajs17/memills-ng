The temperance movement was a significant cultural phenomenon of the mid 1800's to the early 1900's, and was particularly strong among the religious communities of upstate NY. There was significant overlap between members of the temperance movement and those supporting suffrage, and before that, abolition. Emily, Hannah and Ellen were all active in temperance.

Prior to the Mills moving to Mott's Corners, it is unclear if Emily or anyone else in the family was involved in temperance.

Temperance groups don't appear to be very strong here. The only mention I found was the "Royal Templars of Temperance" who began meeting in 1878. They didn't seem to be very powerful. No date was given as to when they ceased to exist.

There are records of a number of "lodges" of the Independent Order of Good Templars in the Batavia area. There was at least briefly a Corfu lodge of the Good Templars, although I don't yet know if Emily was a member there. This lodge apparently disbanded prior to 1885.

At Motts Corners in the 1880's, Emily was an officer in the Independent Order of Good Templars, in the Brookton chapter called "High Bridge Lodge, No. 296".

As the following news item suggests, the High Bridge Lodge in Mott's Corners was formed in March 1875, the year that the wooden trestle was being constructed, further suggesting that the trestle inspired the naming of the lodge, and not say "upper bridge".

> The Utica, Ithaca and Elmira Railroad was later known as Elmira, Cortland and Northern Railroad. In 1905 it was absorbed by the Lehigh Valley Railroad. The tracks came out of Ithaca at East Hill up the north side of Six-Mile Creek valley, crossed Brookton on the trestle, crossed the DL&W tracks at Caroline Junction, and continued on to Willseyville. 
> 
> In 1874 the wooden trestle at Brookton was started, and completed in December 1875. It was made of foot-square timbers cut from area forests and set close together in several tiers 1600 feet long and 85 feet high. It was built for the Utica, Ithaca and Elmira Railroad. "The wooden trestle required a watchman to cross it on foot after each train, just to make sure no fire had started anywhere in its timbers. 
> 
> "As the old trestle weakened, it seemed so frightening that passenger trains stopped at the approach to either end and let fearful passengers walk across if they chose. 
> 
> "In 1894 the wooden structure was replaced by one of steel. The work was done by Moses Hurlbut and his crew was quite remarkable, too, in that traffic was never completely stopped for the replacement. The metal bridge was placed without fully tearing down the old wooden one beforehand. 
> 
> "The crew worked through the week preparing sections of the old trestle for removal and then, on Sunday, when no trains ran, a single span would be cut out and replaced. During the entire rebuilding program, not one train missed its schedule because of the trestle-builders' activities."(Ithaca Journal--Glance Backward by Barbara Bell) 
>
> The steel trestle was about 800 feet long and 85 feet high at its highest point over the valley. It was called "the new bridge" and Lyman Gallagher of Slaterville said that "old valley residents who had lived 50 years in the protection of that gigantic wooden windbreak, practically were blown out of their homesteads when the new steel bridge failed to stop the force of the winds up the valley." 
>
> Lehigh Valley Railroad service was discontinued on 1 July 1935 on the old branch line over the stretch from Van Etten to East Ithaca. The "last" passenger train out of Ithaca to Owego over the 110 year old Cayuga-Susquehanna & Western branch of the Delaware, Lackawanna & Western Railroad, was on Palm Sunday and in short order, the trestle was taken down by a small crew of Bethlehem Steel company workmen.

The "Great Iron Bridge at Brookton" in the photograph below replaced the wooden trestle and was dismantled in the final years of Emily's life. A version of the following postcard can be found on page 57 in *The Towns of Tompkins County: From Podunk to the Magnetic Springs* edited by Jane Marsh Dieckmann, which states it was taken in 1907, when Edward Mills was still alive. Note that the photographer is standing on or very near the "brow of the hill" that forms the western boundary of the Mills' Home parcel. I have tried to recreate this photograph to get a more exact idea of where the photographer was standing, but the view is now obscured by trees, making it difficult. However, I think that the photographer was in the general area of the concrete marker on the hill brow as the hill starts descending back toward Brooktondale Road, above where the concrete retaining wall is presently. That concrete marker is represented on the survey maps of 475 Brooktondale Road.

The trestle was dismantled in the final years of Emily's life. The trestle was easily visible from both Mills' Store and Mills' Home.

> As automobile and truck traffic increased, train traffic decreased. When the Brooktondale trestle was damaged in the 1935 flood, it was abandoned by the Lehigh Valley Railroad and demolished for scrap.The Brooktondale and Besemer stations closed.
