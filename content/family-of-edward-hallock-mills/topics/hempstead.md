Edward presumably moved to Hempstead with his family in 1837. There, he met his first wife, Mary Ann Pine, and her brother and Edward's mentor in business, Charles Mills Pine. The Mills and the Pines attended Christ's First Presbyterian Church. This section also introduces Captain John Seaman.

In 1837, when Edward was approximately 18 years old, the Mills family moved to Hempstead NY, according to Jonas' obituary. It appears likely that Edward followed the rest of the family to Hempstead, as it is noted in the Hempstead Sentinel that Edward lived there at one time.

Jonas and Mary Platt Mills' first child Sarah died a few years prior to the family's move to Hempstead, when she was only a year and a half old.  When the family arrived in Hempstead, their second child Robert was just a few years old.  

In the 1840 census in Hempstead, several related names are found, including Seaman, Rhodes, Bedell, and specifically, Luther Loper, Samuel Pine and Jonas Mills, Edward's father:

Hempstead is also referred to historically as South Hempstead, and was part of Queens County before the creation of Nassau County, which then became its designated county. 

<figure>
<blockquote>
<p>If Hempstead were to be incorporated as a city, it would be the second-largest city in New York, behind New York City; it is about three times the size of Buffalo, which has long been the state's second-largest city. ...Hempstead is thus the most populous municipality in the New York metropolitan area outside New York City.
</p>
<p>
...During the American Revolution, the Loyalists in the south and the American sympathizers in the north caused a split in 1784 into "North Hempstead" and "South Hempstead". With the 1898 incorporation of the Borough of Queens as part of the city of New York, and the 1899 split of Queens County to create Nassau County, some southwestern portions of the Town of Hempstead seceded from the town and became part of the Borough of Queens.

For Edward to move to Hempstead as a young man fits with other known facts and greatly adds to our understanding not only of his early adulthood, but the rest of his life. In Hempstead, Edward met two very important residents: Mary Ann Pine, who became Edward's first wife and mother of Emily Mills, and Mary Ann's brother, Charles Mills Pine, who became Edward's employer and mentor in the grocery business.
 
A few years prior to the Mills' move to Hempstead, Charles was already living there, newly married to Elmira Loper whose family also lived in Hempstead and attended Christ's First Presbyterian Church. Charles is presumably the Pine (or perhaps it is his father Nicholas?) of the general store Weekes, Seaman & Pine. Hempstead was presumably when Edward's and Charles' paths first crossed, and it would seem likely that Edward may have initially worked at Weekes, Seaman & Pine. To understand Edward's life, one must understand the life of Charles Pine, which Edward emulated in many ways.

Weekes, Seaman & Pine was possibly owned by some of the same partners as the previous firm of Weekes, Seaman & Co. in the same village:

Jonas' obituary noted that he lived in Hempstead "with the exception of a few years", which included 1850, where he is recorded in the United States Federal Census in Islip NY, at age 55, a "farmer". The family appears to return to Smithtown by 1851, when Mary Platt is readmitted to Smithtown Presbyterian on 03 Jan 1851 and then returns to Hempstead as evidenced by her removal from the church, "by certificate to Hempstead" 05 Jun 1858. The very next day, Edward's brother Robert is baptized in Hempstead along with his future wife, whom he marries several weeks later.

In 1850, Edward was living in Factoryville (West New Brighton) [Staten Island]({{% ref "staten-island" %}}), and he married his first wife [Mary Ann (Pine) Mills]({{% ref "mills-mary-ann-1819" %}}) (08 Feb 1819 to 28 Dec 1895) in Hempstead. Charles Pine's grocery store in Staten Island was established in 1848, likely narrowing the timeframe for when Edward moved to Factoryville.

Interestingly, Reverend Locke is buried in Batavia NY, exactly 13 miles (according to Google Maps) from Evergreen Hill Cemetery in Corfu NY, where Edward and Mary Ann are buried. The Reverend's only surviving daughter at the time, [Fanny Spencer Locke, 2nd](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/8113448/fanny-spencer-locke) (1860 to 16 Jul 1862) died a week before his death, and his father, [Dr. John Locke](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/210514773/john-locke) (1784 to 01 Aug 1862) died two weeks after his death. (Fanny was the older sister of [Fanny Smith Locke](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/8113260/fanny-smith-locke) (1854 to 06 Jun 1855). It was likely only a few months after the Reverend's death that the Mills moved to [Corfu NY]({{% relref "corfu" %}}).

Both the Mills and Pines attended Christ's First Presbyterian Church in Hempstead. Many other family names can be found in the Church's records that are either relatives of Mills and Pines or otherwise connected with them, including Seaman, Gildersleeve, Higbie, Weekes (also Weeks), Hawkins, Bedell and Mersereau. It is perhaps relevant that the surname "Watts" is also present and may provide context for understanding Edward's nephew's middle name (which he commonly went by).

<figure>
<blockquote>
The history of Christ's First Presbyterian Church is closely identified with the history of Hempstead. In 1643, the Rev. Robert Fordham and John Carman found a suitable location for settlement here and purchased land from the Native Americans. Families came to settle the next year. They received a patent from the Dutch governor of the New Netherlands and the church was organized under Rev. Richard Denton. Rev. Denton had first settled in the Massachusetts May Colony, but left for Weathersfield, Connecticut in 1635 in order to practice Presbyterianism. Later, he and his followers came to Long Island for religious reasons. They established Christ's First Presbyterian Church in 1644. It is one of the oldest Presbyterian Churches in the country.

Edward and his half-brother Robert are the only relevant Mills I have found in the Church records, and coverage of the Pine family in the records is also uneven. And unfortunately, Church records only exist from approximately 1805 onward.

Note that Robert's birth year is generally given as 1835, although one obituary reports 1834. Robert's middle name is generally spelled with a "y", however it should be noted that the records of Christ's First Presbyterian Church at Hempstead consistently spell it with an "i" which may in fact be correct, as that is the spelling used by relative William Sidney Mount.

I know of no formal histories or genealogies of the Pines, and initial searches starting with Mary Ann resulted in very little, so I have had to reconstruct this branch of the Pine tree from remaining documentary evidence. 

From the beginning of this research, Charles M. Pine emerged as a central figure in the Mills' lives, and although I didn't know exactly how at the time, the last name struck me as a very big coincidence, and so I assumed he was related to Mary Ann, and probably quite closely, and that a closer examination of Charles' life would reveal much about the Mills. In time, I slowly compiled evidence proving that Mary Ann and Charles M. Pine were siblings. This fact alone explains much about the Mills' lives.

My ability to make this connection was initially hindered by the fact that of the handful of member-created genealogies on ancestry.com that included Charles and referenced his parents, all showed his parents as some variation of:

  -  [Charles L. Pine](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/58487321/charles-l-pine) (1785 to Apr 1853), whose relation to these Pines, if any, is presently unknown to me. 

  - Sarah Soper (1787 to ?), a person I have otherwise been unable to identify. Her age is listed as 78 in 1865.

(I will add that Charles M. Pines' entries on these genealogies were very incomplete, so he was obviously not the focus of these trees.)

Before moving onto what I believe is overwhelming evidence that Charles M. Pine is Mary Ann's brother, I will try to account for this apparent discrepancy with Charles' parents. It appears that the source of this error may be these entries in the 1865 New York State Census:

{{% fig "pine/1865-census-nys" "800" /%}}

I have also been unable to definitively identify Julia Soper, the 20 year old niece listed. There is a [Julia E. (Oakes) Soper](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/199166807/julia-e-soper) (Nov 1844 to 01 Apr 1910), born in Huntington, who, despite being the correct age, was married to Ezra Soper in 1867, so in the 1865 census she would not have the name Soper. 

I have a theory as to what might be happening, although with some noticeable counterpoints which I will also explore. Taking into account all the evidence I have available, I believe the most logical conclusion is that these two census entries in 1865 are referring to relatives of Charles Pine's wife [Elmira Jane (Loper) Pine](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/199952046/elmira-j-pine) (1813 to 07 Mar 1890). Elmira's parents are:  

  - [Luther Loper](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/178362810/luther-loper) (04 Jun 1780 to 05 Apr 1856), married,

  - [Sarah (Bishop) Loper](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/141069644/sarah-loper) (1783 to 06 Jan 1870). Although the exact birthdates are unknown for both Sarah Loper and "Sarah Soper" (above), Sarah Loper's entry on FindAGrave states she died in her 86th year, which would make her approximately 82 in 1865, mismatching Sarah Soper's reported age in the 1865 census. And admittedly, the census entries certainly look more like "S" than "L", and the surname "Soper" can be found on Staten Island and Hempstead.

All that said, I believe that the apparent "Sarah Soper", "mother" in the 1865 census above is Sarah Loper, Charles' mother-in-law, a widow at the time.

Elmira also had a niece, [Juliet (Loper) Shepard](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/36665791/juliet-shepard) (06 Jan 1845 to 02 Apr 1911), who is the daughter of Elmira's brother [Erastus Harvey Loper](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/33057122/erastus-harvey-loper) (1813 to 1860). Juliet was 20 in when the census was taken in 1865, matching the age of "Julia". Her obituaries state that "she was married to Mr. Shepard November 28, 1872", and so would still have the name Loper in 1865.

However, this may be somewhat obscured by two of Juliette's obituaries, that agree that "her early life was spent in New York City, and following the death of her father in 1860, the family moved to this place [Huntington]." Although, I would point out the vagueness of the relative time reference as well as the phrase "the family".

{{% fig "pine/1911-04-07-The-Suffolk-County-News-Sayville-NY-p4" "350" /%}}
</div>

To further support my theory, consider how similarly the name "Loper" when handwritten, even by Sarah Bishop herself, might easily be misinterpreted as "Soper":

{{% fig "pine/luther-loper-will-0-1" "800" /%}}

I now propose the true Pine genealogy, which I will show documentary evidence for further below, starting with Charles' and Mary Ann's grandparents:

  - **Reuben Pine** (1757 to 1827), married,  

  - **[Jerusha (Mills) Pine](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/108776090/jerusha-pine)** (16 Feb 1754 to 18 Nov 1846). Jerusha does not appear to be descended from Timothy Mills, although she may be a more distant relation under George Mills. If so, this would make Mary Ann a Mills by birth as well as by marriage.

Reuben and Jerusha's son Nicholas is Mary Ann's father:  

  - **[Nicholas Ludlow Pine](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/108776395/nicholas-ludlow-pine)** (? to 03 Sep 1828), married,  

  - **[Rhoda (Seaman) Pine](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/108776309/rhoda-pine)** (24 May 1786 to 26 Sep 1859).

Read more about the Seaman family in the section on [Captain John Seaman]({{% relref "hempstead#the-legacy-of-captain-john-seaman" %}}) further below.

And Nicholas and Rhoda's children are:

  - **Lois Almy (Pine) Snedeker** (1805? to 07 Nov 1890) married William Snedeker (sometimes spelled "Snediker") in 1831 in South Hempstead. Their children include [Livingston Snedeker](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/180916294/livingston-snedeker) (May 1836 to 10 Aug 1906).

</div>

  - **[Abigail Seaman (Pine) Higbie](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/108830062/abby-s-higby)** (15 Feb 1805 to 05 May 1877), spelled "Abby" in the Church records and on her tombstone, but "Abbey" is also used. Both Emily and Edward Mills appear to be mentioned in the Last Will and Testament of Abby's husband Henry Higbie (? to 30 Oct 1881), dated 21 Oct 1881. Abby and Henry were married in 1852 in South Hempstead.

{{% fig "hempstead/NY-gbr-p388" "500" /%}}

  - **[Jerusha Pine](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/108830285/jerusha-pine)** (? to 31 Aug 1860) presumably named for her grandmother Jerusha (Mills) Pine listed above.

  - **[Charles Mills Pine](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/199952123/charles-m-pine)** (1812 to 08 Oct 1897), approximately 16 years old when his father died. Read more about Charles' life and family in the [Staten Island]({{% relref "staten-island" %}}) section. 

  - **[Samuel Mills Pine](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/180274612/samuel-mills-pine)** (26 Nov 1814 to 14 Mar 1880), 13 years old when his father died.

{{% fig "hempstead/NY-gbr-p251" "500" /%}}

  - **[Mary Ann (Pine) Mills](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/75958702/mary-ann-mills)** (08 Feb 1819 to 28 Dec 1895), nine years old when her father died.

{{% fig "hempstead/nygb-v54-p30" "500" /%}}

Although some birthdates are missing, the birth order is likely correct based on the following, which is also the most complete documentary evidence of the family members, linking together Mary Ann, Charles M., and Samuel M., in the will of their father, Nicholas Pine:

## The Legacy of Captain John Seaman

Mary Ann (Pine) Mills, through her mother Rhoda (Seaman) Pine, is descended from Captain John Seaman, the American progenitor of the Long Island Seaman families and one of the original settlers of Hempstead. The Seaman family history is summarized in 1928, [The Seaman family in America as descended from Captain John Seaman of Hempstead, Long Island](https://archive.org/details/seamanfamilyinam00seam/page/n15/mode/2up) by Mary Thomas Seaman, archive.org. Selections from this work will be cited as "Seaman" below. 

<figure>
<blockquote>
The Seaman family was originally Danish. In old Norse times the members of families banded together, and sailed the wide seas over in their ships of beauty, getting what they might and holding what they could. On one of their excursions they landed off the eastern coast of England, whipped the natives and held the land. They remained in possession until subdued by the Norman Conqueror, 1066. They passed under the name of “Sea Men” (men of the sea). One of these leaders joined the Crusaders in the Third Crusade, 1187, under Richard Coeur de Lion, gained renown in the Holy Land, and on his return from Jerusalem was knighted by the king and given a Coat-of-Arms and a Crest. This Coat-of-Arms and Crest consists of a shield crossed by wavy bars of azure and gold, emblazoned with a Crescent and surmounted with a Crest, a demi sea horse, arising out of the Crescent. The wavy bars of azure and gold and the sea horse represent the sea or calling of the family. The crescent represents the part taken in the Crusade.

"Three brothers came over, one went back, and two remained." Of these two who remained one was Captain John Seaman, the pioneer settled on Long Island.

<p>The Progenitor of the Seaman Family on Long Island:
</p>

1\. Captain John Seaman, was born in Essex, England, between 1603 and 1610, came to America in 1630 with the Winthrop fleet of ten vessels, nine hundred immigrants, and died early in 1695 in Hempstead, Long Island. His will is dated August 5, 1694, and was proved March 20, 1695.

In 1631 and 1632, John Seaman, Thomas Moore, William Cooper, John Underhill and others were co-operating with Captain John Mason, John Winthrop and Sir Richard Saltoustall, in the efforts to effect settlements in New Hampshire and these colonizations efforts not being successful, we next find all of these, a little later on, in Connecticut and Long Island.

They were not Pilgrims, but were a Puritanic section still adhering to the Church of England.

Captain John Seaman and others went from their first landing to Watertown, Massachusetts, which they left to escape the imposition of a tax, which the Massachusetts Bay Colony proposed to levy on all the settlers for the purpose of fortifying Newtown (now Cambridge). From Watertown they went to Wethersfield, Connecticut, where they stayed but a short time, having some dissensions concerning church matters. In 1636 John Seaman owned two acres of land at Wrights Island in Wethersfield.

In the Catalogue of Puritanic settlers of Connecticut we find it recorded: "John Seaman, one of the original purchasers of the town of Stamford, where he settled in 1641. It is supposed he moved from Wethersfield to Stamford." The settlers at New Haven who had no charter has purchased property in various places, among them being what is now called Stamford, Connecticut, and an arrangement was then made with these discontented settlers of Wethersfield and the settlement at New Haven, by which the Colony from Wethersfield obtained right to settle Stamford, then called Rippowam. The list of these settlers included the name of John Seaman, the purchase price being on hundred bushels of corn, and John Seaman obtained six acres.

"From Roxbury, Massachusetts, he (John Carman) went to Wethersfield, Connecticut, and thence in company with John Seaman whose ancestors were also burned at the stake in England." 

John Seaman owned land in Salem, Mass., in 1643.

In 1646 John Seaman and his brother Caleb are recorded in New Haven, Conn. At this period came the Pequod Indian War, and Captain John Mason was given chief command (as Major) of the Connecticut Troops. To John Seaman he gave command of one of the Companies and John Strickland (who later became his father-in-law) was lieutenant of John Seaman's company. Hence John Seaman's title of Captain. The histories of the day record "John Seaman, later of Hempstead, Long Island, bore arms with demi-seahorse for crest." Another record states that on October 6, 1646, Caleb Seaman was fined 10 shillings for not carrying arms, and on November 3, 1646, "Caleb Seaman desired his fine might be remitted for defect of arms, he going shortly for England. Upon his request it was remitted provided he goe [sic] for England."

Captain John Seaman was one of the sixty-two original signers (in Connecticut) of the Hempstead compact of land, and in 1647 we find him settled in Hempstead, Long Island, where he became on of the most prominent men for half a century "and had left such a host of descendants as to be remarkable, genealogically.

The Town Records of Hempstead, Long Island, state: 

"It seems probable that in the previous year Captain John Seaman coming from the eastern end of the island, had settled land adjoining what was subsequently the eastern boundary of the Hempstead Purchase, and had secured title to a tract com prising more than twelve thousand acres, which, in 1685, under the Dongan patent, became part of the town of Hempstead." 

From that time on we find his name in many pages of history, recording a life of ceaseless activity in the establishment of this section of America.

"Once he signed an agreement or pledged his faith he never disclaimed his share of it."

<blockquote>
The earlier volume of records, covering the first ten years of the town’s history, and comprising the entries for the years 1643 to 1653, is unfortunately lost. It was in existence as recently as twenty years ago, and is mentioned by Onderdonk as “The Mouse Eaten Book.”

In 1665 he became Captain of Queens County Troop of Province of New York. October 2, 1665, Captain John Seaman served on a Grand Jury at Hempstead in a charge of witchcraft, "but–let it be recorded to the credit of John Seaman–the accused was not convicted."
