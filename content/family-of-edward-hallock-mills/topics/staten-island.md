Edward and Mary Ann began their marriage in Staten Island NY where they lived throughout the 1850's and where each Mills child was born. Here, Edward presumably learned the grocery business from Mary Ann's brother, [Charles Mills Pine](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/199952123/charles-m-pine) (1812 to 08 Oct 1897), who eventually co-owned E. H. Mills & Co. in Corfu. Edward presumably worked in Pine's general store, which  was located in West New Brighton, also known as Factoryville, a neighborhood in the Staten Island town of Castleton, and was known as Pine, Hillyer & Co. and then C. M. Pine & Son. The Mills are members of the Reformed Dutch Church of Port Richmond, where Charles Pine was a longtime member of the church consistory.

It appears that Edward Mills first met Mary Ann and Charles Pine when he moved with his family to [Hempstead]({{% relref "hempstead" %}}) in the mid-late 1830's and Edward's move to Staten Island may have coincided with the establishment of Charles Pine's grocery business, incorporated there in 1848. When Edward and Mary Ann married in 1850, Edward is said to be "of Factoryville", the Staten Island neighborhood where Charles Pine's store is located.

Multiple census records confirm that all the Mills' children were born in Staten Island, and they were baptized in the Reformed Dutch Church of Port Richmond.

I continue to search for the birth dates for James and Emily, but these may be lost forever.

<p>
The "Old Town" collection contains record of births that occurred in the Towns of Northfield, Southfield and Westfield for 1847-1865. The births were recorded in libers (not certificates) and are available on microfilm in room 103. The Municipal Archives does not have records for the rest of Richmond County for the period in question. 
<p>
</p>
I have researched the records available here for the three births and unfortunately found none of them. Despite the law passed in 1847 mandating recordkeeping of vital records in NY State, and subsequent updates to the law, it wasn't until after new legislation in 1919  that the recording of births were enforced. Knowing that, there may not be a NY State birth record.

James Wheelock Mills apparently died as a young child sometime between his 31 July 1857 baptism and the 1860 United States Federal Census in Castleton, Staten Island NY which shows the Mills family otherwise complete except for James, living at the residence of [Bartlett Brown](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/199802084/bartlett-brown) (1833 to 24 Nov 1902), another protege of Charles M. Pine in the grocery business, and later, Bartlett succeeded Charles as President of the Richmond County Mutual Insurance Company.

{{% fig "census/census-1860-us" "800" /%}}

The 1860 census indicates the town is Castleton. Castleton is the name of one of the original four towns of Staten Island and Factoryville was the colloquial name at the time of one its neighborhoods, West New Brighton.

 According to the following tax assessment, Bartlett also lists Factoryville in the "Residence" column.

Bartlett Brown's parents are [Abram Brown](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/20577929/a-brow) (10 May 1802 to 10 Feb 1874) and [Hannah Hawkins](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/122608336/hannah-brown) (04 Feb 1804 to 14 Aug 1879). It is interesting to note that there are items Hawkins items in the <a href="https://www.queenslibrary.org/manuscripts/0205#bg-largeview-about">The Mills Family of Jamaica and Mills Pond, Long Island</a>, Archives at Queens Library, Queens Borough Public Library, Jamaica NY: a "Hawkins family" folder and a folder containing Hawkins genealogical data. I have yet to personally examine these.

Bartlett Brown was born in Oak Farm on Long Island NY and according to the 1850 census, when Bartlett was 17 years old and still in school, he and his family were living in Huntington on Long Island NY. He then moved, first to Brooklyn, then onto Castleton in Staten Island NY by 1857 to work at Pine's general store.

Based on the 1860 census, and assuming Bartlett's obituary is accurate, we can surmise the Mills were residing with Bartlett at "the adjoining house" to "the valuable property at the corner of Broadway and Castleton Avenue". The Beers map from 1874 shows "B Brown" in the southwest corner at Broadway and Castleton, and the "adjoining house" referred to may be the structure shown at the corner of State Street and Castleton Avenue, or possibly the one next to it, both of which are labelled as "DWG." on the 1885 Sanborn map.

The representation of the property on some maps does seem to show these two corner structures were "adjoined" in later years.

The following are Google Maps street view images of Bartlett Brown's property, captured in 2022.

Webb's Consolidated Directory of Staten Island from 1886 lists Brown’s general store, referencing 114 Broadway, the address mentioned in his obituary,  as well as a reference to the home on State Street "near" Castleton Avenue. This description opens the possibility of a different interpretation of which building was the home: as the directory legend below shows, there is an abbreviation for "corner" which would seem to be more appropriate than "near" in this case, and the Beers map indicates Bartlett owned the other lots on that block (although those other lots could have been purchased after the Mills left Staten Island, obviously), so perhaps the home the Mills lived in was the building immediately below the highlighted one, number 424 on the Sanborn map, which is also describe as a "DWG". (Or perhaps Brown moved into that home at a later time?)

{{% fig "staten-island/1886-staten-island-directory-p117" "500" /%}}

{{% fig "staten-island/1886-webbs-consolidated-directory-p65" "500" /%}}

But if I understand the maps and references correctly, Brown's main storefront faced Broadway and the front of the home faced the opposite direction onto State Street, where the Sanborn map seems to indicate a porch. 

Other maps showing this property include the Colton and Dripps maps which both indicate only three structures on that block:

Bartlett Brown's son [Bartlett Brown Jr.](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/199802139/bartlett-brown) (04 Mar 1870 to 15 Dec 1946), apparently known locally as "Bartie", succeeded him in business:

The early 1860’s were a time of significant life changes for both Bartlett Brown and the Mills family. Bartlett Brown started a new grocery store, married a few months after the census was taken, and started a family of his own, as documented in the records of the Reformed Dutch Church and the 1865 census. The Mills moved to Corfu sometime between the Summer of 1862 and the Spring of 1863, during a period in which the Battle of Antietam in Sharpsburg MD was fought just a few hundred miles southwest of Castleton, and just before the draft riots on Staten Island. 

{{% fig "staten-island/RDC/rdc-scan_151-p144" "800" /%}}

{{% fig "staten-island/census-1865-nys-brown" /%}}

Bartlett honored his former employer and friend by naming his son after him:

{{% fig "staten-island/RDC/rdc-scan_083" "800" /%}}

Edward and Bartlett appeared to work together at Charles Pine's store, and perhaps Edward worked for Bartlett as Bartlett was first starting his own store. Whatever role, if any, Edward had in Bartlett's new store, it seems reasonable to assume that seeing his co-worker take this risk, and perhaps seeing the process first-hand, must have only encouraged Edward to take an even bigger risk of his own just a few years later when he also started his own store in [Corfu NY]({{% ref "corfu" %}}). 

As already mentioned, Charles M. Pine and James A. Hillyer (1831/2 to 20 Mar 1925) were listed as co-owners of E. H. Mills & Co. in Corfu:

{{% fig "corfu/1869-Gazetteer-Business-Directory-Genesee-County-inset" "400" /%}}

(James M. Hillyer is a presumed misprint of James A. Hillyer.)

Charles M. Pine is Mary Ann Mills' brother. He married Elmira (sometimes spelled as "Almira") Jane Loper in 1835 in South Hempstead, New York. It was just two years later that Edward likely moved with his father Jonas to Hempstead, also known as South Hempstead. 

{{% fig "staten-island/1835-02-21-charles-pine" "800" /%}}

Weekes, Seaman & Pine was a general store in Hempstead, possibly with some of the same partners as the previous firm of Weekes, Seaman & Co. in the same village:

Charles Pine was a prominent and prolific business man who was a central figure in the lives of many other successful proteges and business partners that included Edward Mills, Bartlett Brown, James Hillyer, Mark Hartley, and Charles' own sons, [Charles Theodore Pine](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/26215884/charles-theodore-pine) (? to 28 May 1895) and [Alverade Richmond Pine](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/199952865/alvarade-r-pine) (1850 to 21 Aug 1929).

Charles Pine continued his grocery business in Staten Island starting in 1848, and the Beers map (explored further below) confirms what other histories describe, that there are two stores associated with Charles Pine: C. M. Pine & Co., and the location next to his residence that was known earlier as Pine, Hillyer & Co. and later as C. M. Pine & Son. Presumably, Edward Mills worked for Charles at least some of the time that he lived in Staten Island, and it seems likely Edward moved to Castleton because of Charles. Edward may have worked at either or both locations.

<blockquote>
"Squire John" [Bodine] owned considerable property on the North Shore, among which was the mill, and the pond, and the land east of it, including the old Dongan Manor house, which he subsequently sold to his father, who died in that house in 1835. He also owned the property now occupied by the store of Pine, Hillyer & Co., the residence of Mr. C. M. Pine, and the dwelling west of it, in which he lived at the time of his decease.

Charles' occupation is "merchant" in Castleton in the 1850 Federal census, and James Hillyer lives with the Pine family, as a clerk, presumably also working in Charles' store. Note that roughly coinciding with the establishment of Charles Pine's store James Hillyer's grandfather John Hillyer as well as Nathaniel Seaman, both died in 1848.

{{% fig "staten-island/1850-us-census-castleton" "800" /%}}

Both the 1850 and 1860 census show [George Mersereau](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/182609528/george-mersereau) (24 Apr 1835 to 08 Mar 1896) also living with the family of Charles Pine. Charles appears to have taken over the general store in Staten Island from George Mersereau's father and brother, and George worked as a clerk for Charles for some time. George was a Civil War veteran, and he went on to become successful in business himself; in several places he is credited with rebuilding St. Andrews Church, although is obituary doesn't explicitly mention this.

<blockquote>
<p>
Anglicans established the Church of St. Andrew at the head of the Fresh Kills in the early 18th century. A graveyard and church were begun by 1709 and the stone church building completed in 1712, adding a major institutional presence to the growing hamlet of Richmond. The church was granted its charter by Queen Anne in 1713.
</p>
<p>
In 1770 the original church building was enlarged and a tall, elegant steeple was added. The steeple followed a design published by the English architect James Gibbs. With its location on a hill adding to the effect of the tall steeple, the church became an important monument that was visible from miles away.
</p>
<p>
During the American Revolution, the church was a center of military activity. Rev. Richard Charlton, who was a rector of St. Andrew’s at the start of the Revolution (until 1777), is remembered as the grandfather of Saint Elizabeth Ann Bayley Seton, who was the first native-born U.S. citizen to be canonized by the Roman Catholic Church; Charlton and Seton family members are among the distinguished early citizens whose graves can be found in the church’s cemetery.
</p>
<p>
The early church building was severely damaged by fire on March 29, 1867 and again in October 1872. During the periods of rebuilding, services were held in the nearby Reformed Dutch Church.
</p>
<p>
Today, the Episcopal Church of St. Andrew is an active faith community. The current structure, attributed to builder George Mersereau in 1872, is noted for the English influences in its design. It was designated a New York City landmark in 1967 and was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2000. The adjoining Burch Hall was built in 1924.

In 1865, Mark Hartley is also living with Charles M. Pine, occupation "clerk", presumably in Pine's general store. Later, Mark Hartley co-owned the general store Hillyer & Hartley, along with James Hillyer's brother Abraham Hillyer.

{{% fig "pine/1865-census-nys" "800" /%}}

By 1859, Charles' general store is known as Pine, Hillyer & Co., co-owned with James Hillyer. The 1874 Beers map shows "General Store of Pine, Hillyer & Co.", in an area described below as "the bend between Van Street and Broadway" at 188 Richmond Terrace (also called "Shore Road", at least to the west of Pine's store). Comparing a number of historical maps of Castleton to present day maps, it is striking how the major road names and their courses have remained consistent over these many years, as exemplified by the bends in this stretch of Richmond Terrace.

The 1885 Sanborn Fire Insurance Map shows the structures in more detail, including important aspects of what the buildings were made of and some other characteristics of their appearance.

{{% fig "staten-island/1885-sanborn-p20" "800" /%}}

{{% fig "staten-island/1885-sanborn-p1" "500" /%}}

The structural notations in the Sanborn map confirms what can be seen in the following photo of the Pine residence, which also shows the side of Pine's "Gro. & Gen'l S.". The residence is a 2 1/2 story frame building with a shingled roof, and the store next to it is a 3 story brick structure, with windows on the alley wall on all three floors toward the front, with three more windows on the ground floor behind those. Also visible is the wood cornice on the storefront that is indicated in the Sanborn map, as well as the side of the shed in the rear of the store next to the stables.

{{% fig "staten-island/pine-residence" "800" /%}}

Although I don't have documentary evidence for this currently, I think it is reasonably likely that the Mills family lived at the Pine residence at some point, as other employees, proteges, and extended family lived with Charles Pine over the years.

The following are Google Maps street view images from Richmond Terrace captured in 2022 that show the buildings in the footprint of Pine's store and residence. "Apollo Intl." is in the area of Pine's residence, but the brick building to the left may be Pine's store intact.

It is also interesting to note that the Factory Lake (sometimes referred to as Factory Pond) raceway flows behind Pine's store, where stables are indicated. Factory Lake became quite polluted and was filled in by the early 1900's, and is the location today of Corporal Thompson park, named after the first African-American from Staten Island to be killed in action in the Vietnam War, in 1967.

It appears that by 1878, James Hillyer had left Pine's store and started a new store on Richmond Terrace with his brother-in-law [Barnett Egbert](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/118458051/barnett-egbert) (1837 to 1916), called Hillyer & Egbert. At some point, Charles' son joins his grocery business which is then called C. M. Pine & Son or, in some places, Charles M. Pine & Son.

James A. Hillyer's business partner is his brother-in-law [Barnett Egbert Jr.](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/118458051/barnett-egbert) (1837 to 1916), who married James' sister  [Alice Elizabeth (Hillyer) Egbert](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/118458007/alice-e-egbert) (1841 to 1915).

James Hillyer appears to be connected with William Snedeker, who married Charles' and Mary Ann's sister Lois Almy (Pine) Snedeker (1805? to 07 Nov 1890). William and Lois moved to Staten Island in the 1850's, and William was also in the dry goods business. William Snedeker and James A. Hillyer were also leaders withing the congregation of the Trinity Methodist Episcopal Church, near James' home.

The 1870 US Census and the 1875 NY Census show William Snedeker's family living near James Hillyer's family, and near both the Methodist Church and C. M. Pine & Co.

(As evident from these census entries, James A. Hillyer's wife Phoebe (22 Jul 1834 to 05 Feb 1914) had the middle name "Anna" and apparently had the nickname "Annie".)

A summary of the census data for William Snedeker during the relevant time period: 

<figure>

| Year | Location | Age | Occupation|
| --- | --- | --- | ---|
| 1850 | NY Ward 17 | 39 | hosiery |
| 1860 | Castleton  | 48 | merchant (son and neighbor, Livingston is "merchants clerk") |
| 1870 | Castleton  | 59 | dry goods merchant |
| 1875 | Castleton  | 60 | dry goods (son Livingston and wife are "boarders") |
| 1880 | Castleton  | 69 | boarder (living with son Livingston) |

</figure>

(At different times, Livingston was a reporter for the *Richmond County Advance* as well as a "slate dealer" among other careers.)  

Before he moved to Staten Island, the firm of Wm. Snedeker & Co. "dry goods jobbers" was located in the Manhattan financial district just a few blocks northeast of the future site of 1 World Trade Center and 2 World Trade Center, the "Twin Towers" that collapsed in the September 11 attacks of 2001.

<blockquote>
A dry-goods jobber is a wholesale buyer and seller, for cash or for approved credit, of all manner of goods, wares, and materials, large and small, coarse and fine, foreign and domestic, which pertain to the clothing, convenience, and garnishing, by night and by day, of men, women, and children: from a button to a blanket; from a calico to a carpet; from stockings to a bead-dress; from an inside handkerchief to a waterproof; from a piece of tape to a thousand bales of shirtings; not forgetting linen, silk, or woollen fabrics, for drapery or upholstery, for bed or table, including hundreds of items which time would fail me to recite. All these the dry-goods jobber provides for his customer, the retailer, who in his turn will dispense them to the consumer.

<blockquote>
A factory having produced a stock of goods from the best designs to be obtained by its agents here and abroad, the next step is to sell at a profit. Twenty-five years ago the mill or factory sold all its goods to the jobbers, who in turn distributed them to the retailers throughout the country. Each mill had its selling agents who undertook to dispose of its product to the jobbers. A retailer could buy nothing directly from the agent of the mill. Within the last ten or fifteen years the small jobber has been eliminated. In 1850 there were half a hundred dry-goods jobbers in New York City and as many in Boston all doing a good business. Today the number has dwindled to half a dozen in each city. The same thing is true of Philadelphia and Chicago. Only a few of the very largest jobbing houses have survived. The selling agents of the mills now go direct to the retailer, because the retailers have in many instances become buyers upon a much larger scale than the small jobber of former days. Go into the Boston or New York office of the agent of any important mill, and you will find plenty of samples and clerks, but almost no buyers. The agent now goes to the buyer. The agent of the largest cotton-mill in western Massachusetts told me that he sent his men to every large drygoods shop in Boston every day, and his partner in New York did the same thing there. At certain seasons Boston and New York, twenty-five or thirty years ago, were overrun with the buyers of dry-goods houses from all parts of the country. There were hotels and even newspapers devoted to these buyers and their doings. Much of this business has passed away. To-day the travelling men, “drummers,” of the mills and the few large jobbing houses that have survived, scour the country, taking their samples to the retailer. A few large jobbers, doing an immense business, still survive in all our large centres because they have the machinery for the distribution of goods in channels where it is not worth the while of the agent to enter—small shops in small towns. The small jobber who gave up business when he found the mills selling directly to the retail shops who could buy even more goods at a time than he could, had neither the capital nor the army of travelling men necessary to do business upon this scale. The jobber who could buy five thousand cases of goods at a time, and had the machinery and the means for disposing of it, survives because the mills sell cheapest to the largest buyer, and the jobber who buys on this scale is more important that even the largest retail store. But the small jobber, buying one hundred cases of the same goods, gets no better terms than the big retailer and has therefore no excuse for being. Some of the big department stores now obtain a monopoly of certain patterns or designs by taking the whole output of the mill, thus doing what was formerly in the power of only the greatest of jobbers.

Charles and his son Theodore also had significant business dealings beyond their store. According to data provided by the [Empire State Postal History Society](https://www.esphs.org/), Charles M. Pine was also postmaster of what was then called the North Shore, Staten Island post office from 16 Dec 1850 to 26 Oct 1853. This post office became the West New Brighton station of Staten Island on 21 Jan 1917.

Charles M. Pine was also one of the incorporators of The  Staten Island Savings Bank, which was organized on December  21, 1866, at Stapleton. His son Theodore Pine was a trustee of Richmond County Savings Bank. 

<figure class="quote-only">
<blockquote>
<p>The  Richmond  County  Savings  Bank  was  organized  on  October  30, 1886.  It  was  at  first  located  in  Odd  Fellows  Hall,  West  New  Brighton, until  1899  when  it  removed  to  its  own  building  on  Richmond  Terrace. From  that  it  moved  to  the  handsome  building  it  now  owns  and  occupies at  the  corner  of  Castleton  Avenue  and  Taylor  Street,  West  New  Brighton.  Its  first  officers  were  Monroe  Eckstein,  president;  John  Westbrook,  first  vice-president;  Jacob  I.  Housman,  second  vice-president; Robert  Moore,  cashier.  Trustees :  George  Bechtel,  Thomas  Humphrey, Stephen  D.  Simonson,  Richard  L’H.  Finch,  <strong>Charles  T.  Pine,</strong>  Charles W.  Hunt,  Charles  W.  Kennedy,  John  W.  Winmill,  Otto  Ahlmann,  Daniel  T.  Cornell,  Thomas  Byrne,  David  Soloman.  By  1900  John  Westbrook  had  become  president  and  the  following  had  joined  the  board, Henry  P.

In  1911  Mr.  Smith  was president  with  the  late  G.  H.  Tredwell  as  secretary.  Upon  Mr.  Tred- well’s  death,  Mr.  Matthius  became  secretary. </p>

## Churches in Staten Island
 
The families of Edward Mills, Charles Pine (including his siblings and their descendants, such as Livingston Snedeker) and Bartlett Brown, along with several Hillyers, including [Abraham Crocheron Hillyer](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/9143966/abram-crocheron-hillyer) (25 Dec 1842 to 14 Oct 1932) of Hillyer & Hartley, and [Alice E. (Hillyer) Egbert](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/118458007/alice-e-egbert) (1841 to 1915), are all members of the Reformed Dutch Church of Port Richmond. Alice is James Hillyer's sister, and she married his business partner, Barnett Egbert—sometimes spelled “Barnet”–also a member of the Church. (Barnett Egbert's father Barnett Egbert Sr. was a Church elder.) Other familiar family names associated with the church include the Bedell's and Mersereau's. 

<figure>
<blockquote>
The Crocheron family have been prominent in the county ; Henry was Member of Congress 1815—'17. Jacob was Member of Congress 1829—'31 ; Presidential elector in 1836; Sheriff 1802, 1811 and 1821. Nicholas was Member of Assembly, 1854. Richard was County Treasurer, and Surrogate, 1836, and for several years thereafter. The family is of French descent.

In the *Records of the Reformed Protestant Dutch Church on Staten Island*, there are the following entries for members with the family name of Mills, that as far as I can tell, are unrelated to Edward Mills:

  - 02 Mar 1850, Jacob H. Van Pelt marries Melinda Mills in Staten Island.
  - 08 July 1864, John B. Martling marries Helen Louisa Mills.
  
The Vanderbilt family is the most famous of the Reformed Church's past congregants.

  <p>The young nation and our Old Dutch Church went through a number of profound changes.</p>

  <p>In the middle of the 19th century, immigrants from Ireland and Germany came to Port RIchmond for jobs in Industries such as whale oil processing, succeeded by linseed oil processing (which operated until the 20th century); lumber and coal yards; dye processing; and oyster harvesting along the mudflats in New York Harbor.  Many successful oyster boat captains built mansions on Richmond Terrace facing the Kill van Kull in the 1840s and 1850s. </p> 
 
  <p>The present church was built in 1844.  The name was changed from Reformed Protestant Dutch Church to the Reformed Church on Staten Island.</p>

<blockquote>
KILL VAN KULL—ARTHUR KULL.

The precise meaning of the Dutch word "Cull," we are unable to give, though it probably had some reference to the water, as Newark Bay was emphatically called "the Cull," and was universally known by that name. The Dutch word "Kill" meant a small stream or passage of water; therefore, the name Kill Van Kull means the stream or passage from the Cull, or Kull, as it is now spelled. Arthur Kull, or Kill, as it is now sometimes written, is a corruption of the Dutch word "achter," after, or behind; therefore, Achter Kull meant behind or beyond the Cull. An attempt has recently been made to change the orthography of the word Van, by substituting the letter O for A, thus, Von, which is neither Dutch nor English, and arises from ignorance of the fact that the Dutch A in this connection has the sound of the English O in the same connection; therefore, to spell the word correctly, it should be written Van, and pronounced Von. We give the above as the explanation of the origin of the Dutch names of these waters. </blockquote>

Finally, here is some basic information on the Presbyterian churches on Staten Island. Although Calvary Church was organized well after the Mills had left Staten Island, it is interesting to note that it was originally comprised of many members of the Reformed Dutch Church. The Methodist Episcopal Church was attended by Mary Ann's sister and James A. Hillyer.

The following table is from [Presbyterian churches and their founding](http://www.nygenweb.net/richmond/churches.html) on nygenweb.net and cites "WPA's Inventory of the Church Archive in New York City — Presbyterian Church in the United States of America. (Historical Records Survey), 1940 as found at nycnuts.net."

I have looked through transcriptions of the Reformed Church's graveyard and could not find an entry for James Wheelock Mills. Kathleen Langdon from the Reformed Dutch Church performed an independent search and also could not find him. Finally, I have also examined the First of Staten Island/Stapleton records on Ancestry.com, and I did not find him there.
