A history of the first 65 years of the Church, beginning weeks before their official organization, are found in one volume:

The volume has been re-bound, likely more than once over the years, so that now it is common for words on the inside edges of pages to be hidden within the more recent binding.

Of the images on this page, those with a white background are scanned images found on a compact disk in the records of the Church, and were likely done by, or at the direction of, Barbara Kone. The remaining images were taken by my phone camera in the Church basement, mostly in Fall 2021, with some additional photographs taken in Spring 2023. 

The numerous overhead fluorescent lights in the basement of the Church made it difficult to avoid casting shadows on the photographs. The green pattern behind is a table covering in the basement of the Church. Elaine Sapp was very helpful and generous with her time helping me with the church's records on these and other occasions. 

In the transcriptions that follow, I normalized inconsistent capitalization and punctuation, but otherwise attempted to faithfully reproduce the text, including misspelled names. 

Also see Amy Atwater's [History of the Congregational Church, Brooktondale, New York]({{% relref "1968-atwater-history" %}}) for a summary of these meetings.

## The Founders

The following are my attempts to identify each person mentioned in the initial meetings, which includes the charter members as well as others including William Hills, the first pastor of the Church.

{{% bcc-founders-table "static/data/bcc-founders.csv" %}}
<footer>
Notes:

  - "Charter" indicates someone listed in the 25 Apr 1868 meeting. "Atwater" indicates additional names listed as charter members in her *[History of the Congregational Church]({{% relref "1968-atwater-history" %}})*. Finally "Smith" are my additions, acknowledging the recorded names of others involved in the founding of the Church that were not already included in other lists.

  - It was at a meeting on Saturday 02 May 1868 when Alamanza Perry and Richard Sloughter "presented themselves for membership on profession of faith". 

  - Urena Genung was present at the 12 Mar 1868 meeting, but apparently not at the 25 Apr 1868 meeting.

More information on Charles W. Personius can be found in the section on [Deeds and Other Past Owners]({{% relref "other-past-owners" %}}).

[Nathaniel. J. Roe](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/24800811/nathaniel-j-roe) (11 May 1831 to 09 Sep 1908) is a farmer in Caroline at the time the church was formed, he would eventually move to Michigan where his occupation is "grocer". He fought in the Civil War, mustering 31 Oct 1864 in Company U of the 179th Infantry Regiment. 

Although the exact spelling is unclear, how “Mariette” is pronounced is clear from how it is spelled in the 1870 census. She is the daughter of James and Cynthia Perry. At that time, she is a domestic servant living in the town of Taylor, Cortland County NY.

The first pastor of the Congregational Church of Mott's Corners was Rev. William S. Hills (16 May 1834 to 26 Oct 1906), who had most recently come from Pottersville PA. His wife is [Julia Ann (Fuller) Hills](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/195170803/julia-ann-hills) (18 Feb 1834 to 10 Jan 1907).
