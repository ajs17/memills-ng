The temperance movement was a significant cultural phenomenon of the mid 1800's to the early 1900's, and was particularly strong among the religious communities of upstate NY. There was significant overlap between members of the temperance movement and those supporting suffrage, and before that, abolition. Emily, Hannah and Ellen were all active in temperance.

Prior to the Mills moving to Mott's Corners, its unclear if Emily or anyone else in the family was involved in temperance.

Temperance groups don't appear to be very strong here. The only mention I found was the "Royal Templars of Temperance" who began meeting in 1878. They didn't seem to be very powerful. No date was given as to when they ceased to exist.

There are records of a number of "lodges" of the Independent Order of Good Templars in the Batavia area. There was at least briefly a Corfu lodge of the Good Templars, although I don't yet know if Emily was a member there. This lodge apparently disbanded prior to 1885.

At Motts Corners in the 1880's, Emily was an officer in the Independent Order of Good Templars, in the Brookton chapter called "High Bridge Lodge, No. 296".
