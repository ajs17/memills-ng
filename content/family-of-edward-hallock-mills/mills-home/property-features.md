This section explores various features of the Mills’ Home property, including the stone foundation and the “large oak tree”.

## The Stone Foundation

I have speculated elsewhere that William Benton Wolcott, a carpenter by trade, who was the first owner of record of Mills’ Home, may have had a direct hand in the construction of the dwelling (see [Deeds and Ohter Past Owners]({{% relref "other-past-owners" %}})), and that Reverend Garrett Mandeville’s grandson John L. Mandeville may have initially surveyed the property after it was divided from the lower grist mill lot (see [The Mill Race Bridge and The Barn]({{% relref "mill-race-bridge-barn" %}})).

Presumably, the stone foundation that sits under Mills’ Home as I write this is the same foundation built for William Wolcott, and if this is true, then its enduring stability over these many years is presumably the result of a skilled stone mason of William Wolcott’s time. I set out to try to learn this craftsman’s identity, and although I cannot say for certain who did the work, I think there are several likely candidates, and one in particular stands out.

The real estate listing I responded to indicated the home was built in 1865, and while I can’t verify this in anything else I have seen, this is probably a good guess, as this coincides with William Wolcott leaving the battlefields of the Civil War, mustering out a few weeks prior to the 1865 census, although the initial deed for the property, which bears his name, is not created until 1869.

Assuming the stone mason was more likely to have lived near the Wolcott Lot, I started with the 1865 New York State Census, looking for variations of “mason” and “stone mason”. Again, I can’t say for certain that every stone mason in the area is accounted for in the census, but several are identified:

The census splits the Town of Caroline into two “districts” at this time: the “First Election District” focuses on Speedsville and Caroline Center and includes some easily recognizable names, including William B. Hallock, a distant relative of Edward H. Mills, as well as Nathaniel Tobey and Peter Webb. “Election District No. 2” focuses on Slaterville and Mott’s Corners, and starting with approximately page 21 of the second district (each district was numbered separately, so this is page 38 sequentially), many recognizable names begin to appear, such as those shown on the Mott’s Corners map published in the 1866 Photographic Atlas of Tompkins County by Stone & Stewart, as well as the founders of the Congregational Church just a few years later. 

It is among the recognizable names of residents of Mott's Corners that [Alonzo B. Northrop](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/194156063/alonzo-b-northrop) (28 Dec 1821 to 20 Jun 1906) appears, and among the stone masons recorded in the 1865 Census, he is uniquely listed on the 1886 Atlas. The Atlas shows "A. B. Northrop”, between the upper bridge over Six Mile Creek and the hill where Brookton (formerly Quick) Cemetery sits, at what is presently 231 Lounsbery Road, near the intersection with the section of Brooktondale Road formerly known as Back Road, or "Easy Street".

Also notice that the census seems to consistently distinguish the occupations of "mason", "stone mason", and "brick layer" and that Alonzo Northrop is by far the nearest "stone mason", and he is listed in the Census directly following Jacob Vandemark, who owned the woolen (carding) mill as well as the lower grist mill next to it, known today as Dalebrook Apartments. Wikipedia provides a possibly relevant explanation:

> Occupations:
>
>   - Mason, brick mason, or bricklayer, a craftsman who lays bricks to construct brickwork, or who lays any combination of stones, bricks, cinder blocks, or similar pieces
> 
>   - Stone mason, a craftsman in the stone-cutting and shaping industry

In 1870, Alonzo was still living in Mott's Corners as a stone mason, according to the Federal Census that year, completely encompassing the window in which the foundation and dwelling were built on the Wolcott Lot.

Therefore, in the absence of specific evidence to the mason’s identity, it seems most probable that he was Alonzo B. Northrop.

Alonzo was married to [Clarissa (Personius) Northrop](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/100183650/clarissa-northrup) (04 Apr 1821 to 24 May 1876). They became members of the Congregational Church of Mott’s Corners.

With the notable exceptions of Alonzo's obituary and death notices (I have not found the same for Clarissa) and Clarissa's grave stone, the family name appears to be most commonly written as Northr**o**p with a "p" and not Northr**u**p with a "u".


I have not been able to visually confirm the placement of the cornerstone:

> The cornerstone (or foundation stone or setting stone) is the first stone set in the construction of a masonry foundation. All other stones will be set in reference to this stone, thus determining the position of the entire structure.

At some point in the past, a concrete floor was poured that may obscure the cornerstone. It may also be in the northeast corner of the basement nearest the bulkhead door, which is presently obscured by a stone platform.

One final, potential point of interest. On the exterior face of the foundation, in the front to the east of the main entrance, there is a stone that has always caught my attention because of markings on its face. These are perhaps natural, or the result of incidental strikes of a chisel, but my perception has always attempted to discern letters intentionally carved into the surface. If that is the case, I haven’t been able to connect these markings to other data available to me.
