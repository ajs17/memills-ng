## The Stone Foundation

I have speculated elsewhere that William Benton Wolcott, a carpenter by trade, who was the first owner of record of Mills’ Home, may have had a direct hand in the construction of the dwelling (see [Deeds and Other Past Owners]({{% relref "other-past-owners" %}})), and that Reverend Garrett Mandeville’s grandson John L. Mandeville may have initially surveyed the property after it was divided from the lower grist mill lot (see [The Mill Race Bridge and The Barn]({{% relref "mill-race-bridge-barn" %}})).

Mills’ Home sits on a stone foundation and its enduring stability over these many years is presumably the result of a skilled stone mason working for William Wolcott. I set out to try to learn this craftsman’s identity, and although I cannot say for certain who did the work, I think there are several likely candidates, and one in particular stands out.

The real estate listing I responded to indicated the home was built in 1865, and while I can’t verify this in anything else I have seen, this is probably a good guess, as this coincides with William Wolcott leaving the battlefields of the Civil War, mustering out a few weeks prior to the 1865 census, although the initial deed for the property, which bears his name, is not created until 1869.

Assuming the stone mason was more likely to have lived near the Wolcott Lot, I started with the 1865 New York State Census, looking for variations of “mason” and “stone mason”. Again, I can’t say for certain that every stone mason in the area is accounted for in the census, but several are identified:

{{% autotable "/static/data/stone-masons.csv" "stone-masons" "name,age-given-i,trade,census-location,page-seq-i,page-num-i,line-num-i" "1865 New York State Census, ancestry.com." /%}}

The census splits the Town of Caroline into two “districts” at this time: the “First Election District” focuses on Speedsville and Caroline Center and includes some easily recognizable names, including William B. Hallock, a distant relative of Edward H. Mills, as well as Nathaniel Tobey and Peter Webb. “Election District No. 2” focuses on Slaterville and Mott’s Corners, and starting with approximately page 21 of the second district (each district was numbered separately, so this is page 38 sequentially), many recognizable names begin to appear, such as those shown on the Mott’s Corners map published in the 1866 Photographic Atlas of Tompkins County by Stone & Stewart, as well as the founders of the Congregational Church just a few years later. 

It is among the recognizable names of residents of Mott's Corners that [Alonzo B. Northrop](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/194156063/alonzo-b-northrop) (28 Dec 1821 to 20 Jun 1906) appears, and among the stone masons recorded in the 1865 Census, he is uniquely listed on the 1886 Atlas. The Atlas shows "A. B. Northrop”, between the upper bridge over Six Mile Creek and the hill where Brookton (formerly Quick) Cemetery sits, at what is presently 231 Lounsbery Road, near the intersection with the section of Brooktondale Road formerly known as Back Road, or "Easy Street".

Also notice that the census seems to consistently distinguish the occupations of "mason", "stone mason", and "brick layer" and that Alonzo Northrop is by far the nearest "stone mason", and he is listed in the Census directly following Jacob Vandemark, who owned the woolen (carding) mill as well as the lower grist mill next to it, known today as Dalebrook Apartments. Wikipedia provides a possibly relevant explanation:

<figure>

> Occupations:
>
>   - Mason, brick mason, or bricklayer, a craftsman who lays bricks to construct brickwork, or who lays any combination of stones, bricks, cinder blocks, or similar pieces
> 
>   - Stone mason, a craftsman in the stone-cutting and shaping industry

In 1870, Alonzo was still living in Mott's Corners, working as a stone mason according to the Federal Census that year, completely encompassing the window in which the foundation and dwelling were built on the Wolcott Lot. Alonzo was married to [Clarissa (Personius) Northrop](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/100183650/clarissa-northrup) (04 Apr 1821 to 24 May 1876). They became members of the Congregational Church of Mott’s Corners.

Clarissa was first cousins with [William Krum Personius](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/162786830/william-krum-personius) (10 Feb 1811 to 25 Apr 1887), as they share the common grandfather [James Jacobus Personius](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/36649297/james-jacobus-personius) (11 Jun 1747 to 14 May 1836). William Krum Personius was the father of [Walker Voorhis Personius](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/98386104/walker-voorhis-personius) (1836 to 1914), dry goods merchant, postmaster and justice of the peace, and [Charles William Personius](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/89338759/charles-w-personius) (1840 to 02 Feb 1924), who owned the lower grist mill at the time that it was divided to create the Wolcott Lot, the future Mills' Home. Both Walker and Charles were Civil War veterans and [founding members]({{% ref "founding-documents" %}}) of the Congregational Church of Mott's Corners.

Therefore, in the absence of specific evidence to the mason’s identity, it seems most probable that he was Alonzo B. Northrop. (Although obviously, multiple stone masons may have worked together on jobs.)

With the notable exceptions of Alonzo's obituary and death notices (I have not found the same for Clarissa) and Clarissa's grave stone, the family name appears to be most commonly written as Northr**o**p with a "o" and not Northr**u**p with a "u".

Clarissa's grave is marked with a stone that is broken as I write this, and which shows clear evidence of past repair attempts. I did not find a marker for Alonzo, and consulting with cemetery caretakers could not verify his exact burial location.

Descendants of Alonzo and Clarissa are also buried at Brookton Cemetery, under the family name Morey.

Another interesting possibility for the identity of the Mills' Home stone mason is William Gale, who is listed as a stone mason in the 1870 census in Mott's Corners. He is living with his second wife, [Harriet (Cutting) Gale](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/100356350/harriet-gale) (12 Aug 1838 to 08 Feb 1904) in the home of her mother [Betsey Elizabeth (Holmes) Cutting](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/99843237/betsey-cutting) (16 Apr 1810 to 07 May 1881) who married [Sewell Cutting](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/99843132/sewell-cutting) (09 Oct 1808 to 26 Feb 1848) on 17 Apr 1840 in Southbridge MA. The 1866 Stone & Stewart map shown above corroborates what the 1870 federal census in Caroline indicates, that "Mrs. B. Cutting" lived directly to the west of Walker V. Personious and his dry goods store.

{{% fig "mills-home/masons/1870-census-p40" "800" /%}}

Previously, in the 1855 New York State Census, William and his first wife Jane are living in Mendon NY, a suburb of Rochester, and although it is a little difficult to read, it appears son Lewis is a month old:

{{% fig "mills-home/masons/1855-06-23-NY-State-Census-Monroe-p36" "800" /%}}

By 1860, they are in Iowa, and interestingly, Lewis' birthplace is recorded as Iowa.

{{% fig "mills-home/masons/1860-06-27-farmersburg-iowa-US-Census-p134" "800" /%}}

Jane's maiden name appears to be Bemis, as the 1855 census presented above indicates that Harriet Bemis ([possible identity](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/8485736/harriet-bemis)), who was born in Portugal, is her mother, which corresponds to this 1850 census entry in Greece NY, another suburb of Rochester: 

{{% fig "mills-home/masons/1850-08-23-US-census-greece-ny-p259" "800" /%}}

It isn't clear when exactly William Gale and his family  moved from Iowa to Caroline. Presumably, Jane died sometime between 1860 and 1870. And in the 1865 New York State Census for Caroline, Harriet Cutting is still unmarried and living with mother Betsey in Mott's Corners: 

{{% fig "mills-home/masons/1865-06-27-NY-State-Census-p22" "800" /%}}

So, I don't know if William Gale was living in Mott's Corners when Mills' Home was constructed.

William Gale is better remembered as the owner of a "tin shop" on the site where Brookton's Market is presently, and in later census entries, he and son Lewis identify themselves as "hardware merchants".

<figure>

> Brooktondale Store, left -- 491 Brooktondale Road

> William Gale had a tin shop on this site for a few years. The Mulks Brothers, Frank, Charles & Fred, had a store here for many years. Robert Tucker bought the property in the late 1920's and built the house next door. The Post Office was at the back, with it's own door. Fred Mulks was the postmaster while he owned the store. By 1866, Willis Shurter's Plaster Mill sat where the present store parking lot is. He also had a fulling Mill.
>
> Jacob Vandemark's woolen mill sat next to the store. It was built before the Civil War. Stockings and mittens were made here and fabric was woven. Fabric woven at home was "dressed". After Jacob's death, his two sons, William and Thomas carried on the business, but it closed in 1890 when it was sold to Fred Bates. It was then the property of Fred Annis, who had a saw mill, and flour mill here. After that, Rightmire and Travis had a hardware store here, then Levi Bacon had a feed store here and put in a dance floor on the upper story. It was burned by an incendiary on 21 April 1916.

William Gale purchased the tin shop lot in 1871 from Willis Shurter, William B. Wolcott's brother in law (Caroline Deeds 3, p74). William Gale purchased several properties that year, and in 1873, William sells the tin shop lot to his son Lewis.

In the 1875 New York State Census for Caroline, Lewis Gale is listed at the Cutting residence as a "tinner", and William Gale is still listed as a "stone mason", although his location at that moment is also indicated as the "tin shop" (see Second Election District, p8).

{{% fig "mills-home/masons/1875-06-00-NYS-census-caroline-p8-gale" "800" /%}}

The 1880 United States Federal Census for Caroline corroborates that the tin shop was between the grist mill and the woolen mill. Lewis and Ellen were married earlier that year, and I do not find William Gale accounted for in this census.

However, it was at this time that the Gale family fell onto financial difficulty. In 1873, William Gale purchased land near the Baptist Church from Walker V. Personius with a mortgage from John L. Mandeville. By 1879, John Mandeville foreclosed on the mortgage and the property was sold at a public auction.  

In 1881, [Calvin Holmes Quick](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/89338732/calvin-holmes-quick) (10 Mar 1856 to 16 Jan 1901), acting as assignee of Lewis Gale, sold the tin shop lot to Sextus B. Landon (Caroline Deeds 4, p76). A few years later, Lewis moved his family to Missouri and eventually Iowa, but as the following news item shows, he returned to Brookton occasionally to visit family.

William Gale's burial site is unknown, but Harriet and daughter Minnie are buried in Brookton Cemetery:

{{% fig "adams-photos/brookton-cemetery/2023-06-11_18.59.37-gray" "800" /%}}

William and Harriet Gale's daughter [Mary J. (Gale) June](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/100357831/mary-j-june) (1869 to 1959) is also buried in Brookton Cemetery. William and Harriet's son [Lewis Gale](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/73648493/lewis-gale) (1855 to 1916) and wife [Ellen A. (Allen) Gale](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/80589547/ellen-a-gale) (Oct 1861 to 21 Jun 1950) are buried in Iowa. 

Returning to the stone foundation itself, I have not been able to visually confirm the placement of the cornerstone of the foundation:

<figure>

> The cornerstone (or foundation stone or setting stone) is the first stone set in the construction of a masonry foundation. All other stones will be set in reference to this stone, thus determining the position of the entire structure.

At some point in the past, a concrete floor was poured that may obscure the cornerstone. It may also be in the northeast corner of the basement nearest the bulkhead door, which is presently obscured by a stone platform.

One final, potential point of interest. On the exterior face of the foundation, in the front to the east of the main entrance, there is a stone that has always caught my attention because of markings on its face. These are perhaps natural, or the result of incidental strikes of a chisel, but my perception has always attempted to discern letters intentionally carved into the surface.
