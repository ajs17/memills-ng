In the 1860's, when Brooktondale was called Mott's Corners, and Brooktondale Road was called Creek Road, the Personius Flouring Mills stood where Dalebrook apartments sit presently, almost directly across the street from Mills' Store, better known to many today as "The Old Postoffice". The Mills' Home parcel was sub-divided from the grist mill property, and it was originally referred to as "the Wolcott lot" for William Benton Wolcott, the first owner of record. The mill race bridge is one of the primary landmarks used to establish the place of beginning for the Mills' Home parcel from the time of its original sub-division from the grist mill to the end of Emily Mills' life. For a long time, I have wanted to know more about the location and size of this bridge, which is an interesting feature in itself, and obviously, its location is important to understanding the history of the property.

> "As a young boy, [Carl English] and his brother had been part of a work crew hired to fill in the creek / stream that ran from the mill pond (between you and the Dalebrook)...across B'dale Rd...through what's now an empty field between the Andersson's and the Todi's property....into Six Mile Creek.  There was a bridge near 475 giving it the nickname "bridge's house" or something like that.  This fill-in, while successful, resulted in fairly unstable land."

First, some background on the grist mill/Dalebrook property itself, beginning with the deed history during the relevant time period that will be discussed.

The grist mill was powered by water diverted from Six Mile Creek into a mill pond located behind Mulk’s Store/Brookton’s Market. 


<figure>

> A mill race, millrace or millrun, mill lade (Scotland) or mill leat (Southwest England) is the current of water that turns a water wheel, or the channel (sluice) conducting water to or from a water wheel. Compared with the broad waters of a mill pond, the narrow current is swift and powerful. The race leading to the water wheel on a wide stream or mill pond is called the head race (or headrace), and the race leading away from the wheel is called the tail race (or tailrace).

The mill pond was behind Mulks' Store, presently Brookton's Market. I have seen a photograph of the grist mill and store that shows water flowing out of the pond into the mill.

I am aware of several visual representations of the grist mill raceway, and of the tailrace that passed through the Mills’ Home lot. In the 1866 Photographic Atlas of Tompkins County by Stone & Stewart, part of the mill raceway is represented, from its origin at Six Mile Creek up to the point that it intersects with Creek Road on its return to the creek after exiting the mill.

{{% fig "brookton/maps/1866-atlas-motts-corners-cropped" "800" "img,cite,link" /%}}

The map was obviously drawn some time before its 1866 publication date, so the absence of Mills' Home is not necessarily inconsistent with its purported construction in 1865.

A collection of Tompkins County highway maps from 1912 depict the course of the mill raceway in more detail, including the only visual representation of the mill race bridge of which I am aware. (This and other maps in the 1912 series also show the Brookton Trestle from a number of perspectives.)

{{% fig "brookton/maps/1912-highway-bf033282-001-p4-cropped" "800" /%}}

{{% fig "brookton/maps/1912-highway-bf033282-001-p2-lower-cropped" "800" /%}}

Though I was initially tempted to believe that the map above showed the eastern property boundary of Mills' Home aligning with the end of the mill race bridge, which would reveal the approximate length of the bridge based on the written deed descriptions that measure from the center of the bridge to the eastern property boundary, it appears that this line, labelled "R818", is not intended to represent the property boundary. Note that this line is solid like other measurement lines on the map, and it is not dashed like the property lines shown. Also, there is an apparently related line to the east of Mulk's store with the same label, which seems to show a measured distance of 818 feet from the edge of the bridge as it existed in 1912 to the similarly labelled line at the edge of the parking lot of Mulk’s Store/Brookton’s Market, and so perhaps this could be reasonably accurately measured today to be able to verify the mill race bridge position relative to the property boundary and dwelling on the Mills’ lot.

Therefore, it seems that **the eastern boundary line is not represented on this map at all**, and note further that 82 links is approximately 54 feet, which strikes me as an unjustifiably enormous span for half of the bridge over the mill tailrace, although according to the 1912 survey, the flow of the tailrace across the road course was angled to the west of a line perpendicular to the road, which would necessitate a larger bridge span. Furthermore, this means that **the “center of the mill race bridge” at the center of creek road is off-center from the bridge edges on either side of the road**. The following attempts to show the angled bridge span, according to the map’s depiction of the tailrace. The solid horizontal green lines depict the bridge guard rails, using as a guide, the northern rail already depicted. The bold red line estimates the center of the bridge at the center of Creek Road:

{{% fig "brookton/maps/1912-highway-p2-lower-cropped-lines" "800" /%}}

However, because this is a highway survey and not a property survey, and because it is clear that the represented property boundaries and structures were not measured for the purposes of this survey, I conclude that all property boundaries on the 1912 survey should be interpreted as approximations, as should the placement of physical structures such as dwellings, and the mill race bridge. 

Obviously, the members of the Mills family would need to cross the mill race bridge, either by foot or wagon, to get to their store and the Congregational Church from their home. Once these improvements were finished, Emily Mills, Hannah Mills, and Ellen Gould, would have exited the front of their home (labelled H) and essentially would have crossed Creek Road in a straight line from the front door, then turned left at the southwestern edge of the bridge guard rail, then crossed the indicated "cement walk" on the southern side of the road that must have been part of the bridge structure.

Another question I often wondered was where the Mills kept horses and carriage that they would presumably have owned. This 1912 highway map provides the only evidence of which I am aware that depicts a barn, indicated with a "B" on the map, that presumably was the structure that housed these. 

{{% fig "brookton/maps/1912-highway-barn-close" "500" /%}}

There appears to be a symbol of some kind next to the structure that I have yet to be able to identify. This structure falls within an area that was later appropriated in the 1960's, and presumably any structure that remained at that time would have been demolished.

What follows are my best attempts to estimate the location of the mill race bridge, which does corroborate its estimated position on the 1912 highway survey. As the surveys that follow will show, Brooktondale Road's previous names and designations included: Creek Road, County Road No. 115 and New York State Route 330, and Cooks Corners-Brookton Highway.

The first deed for "the Wolcott lot" (future 475 Brootkondale Road) as a separate parcel from the grist mill is from 1869:

The transcribed legal property description:

> Being a part of the grist mill lot and bounded as follows. **Beginning in the center of the Creek road, 71 links westerly from the center of the bridge over the race from the grist mill** and running thence south 81 degrees east 1 chain and 43 links to a stake; thence north nine degrees east, four chains & twenty links to the brow of the hill. Thence westerly along said brow of hill to the center of the aforesaid "Creek road". Thence easterly along said center of road three chains & ten links to the place of beginning.

This and subsequent deed deed descriptions use the metes and bounds system and quadrantal compass bearings. 

<figure>

> Prior to the Revolutionary War, when land was surveyed, the “metes and bounds” system was used to define boundaries. The system is still in existence today for land which was acquired before the present system of surveying land was adopted. States which used this form of surveying were the thirteen original colonies (Connecticut, Delaware, Georgia, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, South Carolina, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Virginia) as well as the state land states Hawaii, Kentucky, Maine, Texas, Tennessee, Vermont, West Virginia and parts of Ohio.
>
> In a metes and bounds land description, there is a starting point which is always at a corner. This is followed by directions and measurement which may be written in a variety of ways, indicating a line leading to the next corner. **The corners will generally be a physical feature.** Often the property owners will be mentioned who bound the land being described.

Using landmarks as boundaries and measuring from the center of landmarks seems to be a common practice, presumably to choose a more stable reference point, thus accounting for some variation, such as the growth of trees, the widening of roads, etc. In the Mills' Home deeds and surveys, this practice is used in relation to Brooktondale Road, the mill race bridge, and the large oak tree on the hill.


Although I do not see the name of the surveyor in 1869 documented, it was likely [John L. Mandeville](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/67292637/john-mandeville) (1836 to 29 Nov 1907), the grandson of [Reverend Garrett Mandeville](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/65244680/garrett-mandeville) (18 May 1775 to 11 Dec 1853). John Mandeville was a Civil War veteran and a founding member of the [Congregational Church of Mott's Corners]({{% ref "founding-documents" %}}). He is listed as "surveyor" on the 1866 Stone & Steward map of Mott's Corners:

{{% fig "brookton/maps/1866-atlas-motts-corners" "800" /%}}

<figure>

> By 1865 the Town of Caroline had declined from a peak population of 2,644 to 2,257. Motts Corners, Slaterville, Caroline Center, and Speedsville were significant enough to deserve village maps in the 1866 Atlas. Motts Corners was the largest of these settlements, with a population of three hundred.

Interestingly, John Mandeville advocated for the improved road depicted in the 1912 map and consulted with the surveyors on that project, although he did not live to see it constructed.

In *A Drive-by Tour of the Town of Caroline* sponsored by the Town of Caroline Bicentennial Committee 1994-1995, Tour 4-P9, it is stated that in 1853, John Mandeville had a brickyard next to present-day 341 Brooktondale Road, on the eastern side.

John Mandeville along with William B. Wolcott and Charles Personius were photographed with other GAR members in 1906, in front of Personius Hall.

With the next Mills' Home deed in 1883, a new place of beginning relative to the mill race bridge was established, and this description remained unchanged until Jessie Brewer sold the property to the Jones family. I don't have an explanation for the altered place of beginning.

> The chain is a unit of length equal to 66 feet (22 yards), used in both the US customary and Imperial unit systems. It is subdivided into 100 links or 4 rods. There are 10 chains in a furlong, and 80 chains in one statute mile. In metric terms, it is 20.1168 m long. By extension, chainage (running distance) is the distance along a curved or straight survey line from a fixed commencing point, as given by an odometer.

I will assume that both descriptions refer to the following common points in space:

  **A.** The center of the mill race bridge. It seems implied that this is simultaneously the center of Creek Road.

  **B.** Because the measurement in step 3 of both descriptions is the same distance and bearing from the common point (C) below, the stake referred to in step 2 of both descriptions is the same object at the same point in space.

  **C.** The brow of the hill in the northeastern corner of the property. 

  **D.** The center of Creek Road and the "brow of the hill". This point changed with easements in the 1900's. 

Then I tried to create my own rudimentary survey maps based on these deed descriptions. I should point out that my knowledge of surveying methods is self-taught, so my efforts should be evaluated in that context. 

For distances, I chose to make 1 inch equal to 1 chain, which was a good size to work with and made creating the lines much easier, as then links translates directly into a percentage of an inch. For example, a distance of “4 chains and 63 links” equals 4.63 inches on my pseudo-surveys.

I based the orientation of my maps on the course of Brooktondale Road, which is an essential landmark, along with the mill race bridge, for establishing the place of beginning of the parcel. The portion of Brooktondale Road that fronts Mills' Home has always been represented on maps as a perfectly straight line in the same location. Both the 1866 Stone & Stewart Atlas and the 1912 Highway map corroborate this, showing that the road only begins to gradually curve toward Dalebrook to the east of the Mills parcel. This curve was itself straightened in the mid 1960's when the lower bridge was reconstructed and the Shurter House that sat next to Mills' Store was moved. All of the Mills' Home property surveys corroborate this, as do other maps.

On 06 Mar 2023, at my request and witnessed by me, a new survey of Mills' Home was created that presumably provides the most accurate measurements to date, as it may be the first to use lasers instead of tape. This survey shows the straight portion of Brooktondale Road in front of Mills' Home bearing **N 53° 14' 53" W magnetic**.

For more direct comparison, I will convert all bearings from magnetic to true north. To determine magnetic declination–the difference between magnetic north and true north based on geographic position and time–I will use geographic coordinates derived from the physical address 475 Brooktondale Road, Brooktondale NY 14817: **42° 22' 55" N, 76° 23' 52" W**.

Then, using the document dates for the relevant deeds and survey maps that will be considered, I obtained the following magnetic declination values from the National Centers for Environmental Information Geomagnetic Calculator at ngdc.noaa.gov, using the IGRF2020 model.

Using the bearings given for Brooktondale/Creek Road in the sources above and adjusting for magnetic declination further shows that they all reconcile.

– Recorded bearings for Brooktondale/Creek Road, taken from historical deeds and surveys available from Tompkins County Clerk, Ithaca NY.

  - All data are for 475 Brooktondale Road, "Mills' Home", except for 07 Apr 1972 which is for the adjoining property at 487 Brooktondale Road, Dalebrook Apartments.

  - Using quadrant bearings, the bearing in the opposite direction is the mirror image of the given bearing, so that N xx° yy' W is equivalent to S xx° yy' E in the opposite direction.

  - The 1972 and 2023 measurements are explicitly labelled magnetic on their surveys. 

  - North in the 1969 and 1980 measurements are inferred to be true, as that reconciles all recorded bearings, and this is confirmed in the overlaid surveys below. This also explains why the 1969 and 1980 values (recorded by two different surveyors, Gordon Rice and Howard Schlieder respectively) are only different by one second despite differences in magnetic declination between those years.
 
</figcaption>
</figure>

Based on this analysis, I will assume a bearing of **N 64° 30' W true north** for Creek Road in the 1869 and 1883 legal descriptions.

Note that in both legal descriptions for 1869 and 1883, the distance and bearing in step 3 (between common map points B and C) are the same. And, for simplicity, I will represent the path of the brow of the hill in step 4 as a simple arc. The endpoint of the arc on the road is determined relative to the measured distance from the Place of Beginning.

Although neither the 1869 nor the 1883 deed descriptions specify north, it appears to be true in both cases. The bearings match between them despite a difference in magnetic declination of more than a degree between those years. It is also clear that starting with Gordon Rice in 1969, these descriptions have been interpreted as true north, which seems to be corroborated by iron pipes present before Rice's survey, which appear to be based on the 1883 description, as will be shown further below. 

The 1869 pseudo-survey: 

{{% fig "brookton/maps/surveys/1869-only" "800" /%}}

I overlaid my 1869 pseudo-survey on the 2023 Dresser survey that has also been adjusted to true north for its specific magnetic declination so that the road on each survey is parallel. To match the scale, I lined up the center-line of the road, which has been established as a stable landmark throughout all the referenced deeds and surveys, and scaled the 2023 survey until it overlapped point C on my map in the northeast corner of the brow of the hill, a point that also appears to be consistently located over the years. A dark blue, thick, dashed line drawn perpendicular to Brooktondale Road, shows that the place of beginning in 1869 is roughly in line with the southwestern corner of the original (and still current) footprint of Mills' Home.

The concrete highway monument on the brow of the hill is the general area where the photographer of the following photograph of the "Great Iron Bridge at Brookton" stood with his camera. A version of this photograph can be found on page 57 in *The Towns of Tompkins County: From Podunk to the Magnetic Springs* edited by Jane Marsh Dieckmann, that states it was taken in 1907, the last year of Edward Mills' life. 

{{% fig "trestle/trestle_postcard" "800" /%}}

In 1883, a new place of beginning is chosen, this time to the east of the center of the mill race bridge. I don’t have an explanation for the change. 

Also note that steps 2 and 3 are intended to convey a straight line from the center of the road to the point C on the brow of the hill in the northeastern corner of the parcel. 

{{% fig "brookton/maps/surveys/1883-only" "800" /%}}


The Mills' Home place of beginning as it was described in 1883–82 links east of the center of the mill race bridge–would remain the legal description long after the mill race disappeared and Emily Mills had died. An exact mirror of this description of the eastern boundary line can be found in the grist mill/Dalebrook deeds in that same time period. 

{{% fig "brookton/maps/surveys/235-85" "800" /%}}

As the 1912 road improvements advocated by John Mandeville were being planned, the grist mill ceased operation and eventually the mill race was filled in.

> Dr. Benjamin Lockwood came to provide medical care and became a beloved figure. He built the Dalebrook Apartments in the 1920's, using the foundation and the roof of the old Vorhis mill. When he died in 1934, Dr. Mary Rigway, who had grown up in the Willseyville Valley, took over his practice. She later married Dr. Martin Tinker and moved her practice to a house down the street, where it remains.

> These apartments [Dalebrook], once belonging to Dr. Benjamin Lockwood, were built on the foundations of the grist mill that stood there. There have been three mills at this site which burned. The first was built by Mott, (Mott’s Lower Mill). The last mill was owned by the Vorhis Brothers, and they demolished all but the roof. They took all the materials to Candor to build a stable for a Dr.’s horses. The roof sat over the cellar, and Edbert McMaster and Earl Lupton had a garage here in the 1920’s. Dr. Lockwood had the apartments built, raising the roof and building beneath it. This was about the time that Brookton became Brooktondale.

<p>
Early on after moving there, I did have the unique and wonderful opportunity to meet an elderly man - Carl English who stopped by to chat while I was gardening.
</p>
<p>
I don't remember all of the info he shared....his family owned a dairy farm operation which included land that went from their home (large brick house at the corner of Quarry and Snyder Hill Rds) all the way down into Brooktondale.
</p>
<p>
As a young boy, he and his brother had been part of a work crew hired to fill in the creek / stream that ran from the mill pond (between you and the Dalebrook)...across B'dale Rd...through what's now an empty field between the Andersson's and the Todi's property....into Six Mile Creek.  There was a bridge near 475 giving it the nickname "bridge's house" or something like that.  This fill-in, while successful, resulted in fairly unstable land.

(As I write this, the area between Dalebrook and Mills' Home as well as the area between the Andersson's and the Todi's remain empty.)

In the mid-1960’s massive roadwork was done through Brooktondale that straightened the road. The following highway survey describes a section of the Dalebrook lot near the common boarder with Mills' Home that was appropriated for the "proposed improvements" and it shows the old mill tailrace as a "covered mill race":

{{% fig "brookton/maps/BF162361-001-map-565" "800" /%}}

Again, because this is a highway survey, I interpret all structures and property lines to be approximate, and given that the race is described as "covered" and is shown here as perfectly straight, I assume this is meant to be an abstract/conceptual representation meant only to mark the existence of the tailrace and note the general scope and direction of it. As a result, it is difficult to say very much about it, other than it supports Andrea Talmadge's conversation with Carl English. However, it is intriguing that it seems to indicate the mill race bridge was on the Dalebrook side of the common boundary as it is represented here. There is a non-zero chance that this could be true; if the 1869 and 1883 Mills' Home deed descriptions are re-interpreted as magnetic bearing and re-drawn, the boundary line extend far into what is now considered to be the Dalebrook lot. For completeness, I present some of those maps later.

> When the Brooktondale Fire Company celebrated its first twenty years in 1966, residents were smug about progress since the war. The village had a fire company, natural gas, cable television, consolidated schools, a community center, telephones with direct dialing (no toll to Ithaca!), and now was looking forward to getting a safer road for school buses. From 1962 to 1967, Route 330 through Brooktondale was upgraded, for the first time since 1914. The improvements were greater than anyone expected. The Route 79 intersection was totally changed, and the entire road from there to 76 Road was “modernized.” Whole avenues of maples were lost; the abandoned upper mill was subjected to a spectacular “practice burn” in the summer of 1964; the bridge in front of the store was reconfigured. The old Shurter House, which had survived several floods in its day, was bought for one dollar and moved to its present location at 447 Brooktondale Road. Those who objected to the “Rape of Valley Road” complained that the road went nowhere, because it ended at 76 Road.

The Shurter House sat between Mills' Store and the lower bridge over Six Mile Creek. This was Jessie (Shurter) Brewer's life-long home, and the road work displaced her.

It was perhaps partially a result of this road work that led Gordon Rice to make a mistake in the very first survey map of the 475 Brooktondale Road property. Rice mistook a concrete highway marker for a property boundary marker, and used it as a new place of beginning:

{{% fig "brookton/maps/surveys/rice-only" "800" /%}}

What Rice labeled "Con Mon" would later be found by subsequent surveyors: Thomas G. Miller in a 1972 survey of Dalebrook called it a "H'W'Y MON." and Howard Schlieder in a 1980 survey of Mills' Home called it a "stone mon.".

{{% fig "brookton/maps/surveys/monument-miller" "200" /%}}
{{% fig "brookton/maps/surveys/monument-schlieder" "200" /%}}
</div>

This proves that the Rice survey is not self-consistent: a straight line cannot be drawn that intersects all three points: 1) the iron pipe (IP) at the brow of the hill, 2) the "old iron pipe" in the middle of the hill, and 3) the concrete highway monument near the road.

Miller correctly set a new iron pipe at the road that does fall in a straight line intersecting the other two iron pipes, at a distance 9.5 feet to the east of the concrete highway monument:

{{% fig "brookton/maps/surveys/boundary-miller" "200" /%}}

When Howard Schlieder surveyed Mills' Home in 1980, he apparently detected Rice's error and after consulting the Miller survey of Dalebrook to resolve it, he confirmed that Miller was in fact correct. Schlieder corrected Rice's error on the 1980 survey, along with two explicitly clear notes. On the boundary line itself, he noted all three iron pipes, marks the correct line and adds to that line this text: "property line as of survey in Caroline 1970 pg 11"–a direct citation of Miller’s survey of Dalebrook–and confirming once again that the eastern boundary is a roughly 9 degree line as it has always been described. He also added a clear footnote stating that Rice and Miller did not agree, and that Miller, "the latter" was correct. 

<div class="cols">
{{% fig "brookton/maps/surveys/boundary-schlieder" "200" /%}}
{{% fig "brookton/maps/surveys/note-schlieder" "500" /%}}
</div>

Notice that the eastern boundary in the Rice survey intersects the large oak tree on the hill, whereas both Miller and Schlieder show the center of the crown of the same tree approximately 5 feet west of the boundary line, well within the Mills' Home lot.

Yet Rice's place of beginning lived on in the written legal deed description of Mills' Home:

The area in question was labelled "Tract III" by Schlieder, although I do not see it explicitly referenced as such anywhere else in either the Mills' Home or Dalebrook deeds. I can find only one description of this area at all: in a footnote in the Dalebrook deed at 499/981, Charles C. Vorhis to Frank P. Proto. That deed describes two parcels: 1) Dalebrook and 2) Mills' Store/the old postoffice. The description of Dalebrook specifically describes the boundary with Mills' Home relative to Miller's "iron pipe set" next to the road, and explicitly references the Miller survey (1970/11): 

{{% fig "brookton/maps/surveys/499-981" "800" /%}}

Then, at the end of the description of "Parcel No. 2", Mills' Store, is an asterisk leading to a footnote at the very end of the document that describes the area of Schlieder's Tract III:

{{% fig "brookton/maps/surveys/499-981-triangle" "800" /%}}

I once again created a small pseudo-survey based on this description to verify its placement. It is defined by point C, the iron pipe at the brow of the hill. Recalling that the magnetic declination in 1972 was 10° 29' W, the following adjustments are made to convert the bearings to true north for purposes of comparison:

| Step | Stated Course | True Course | Converted Distance |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | 
| X | N 19° 59' E 320 feet    | N 9° 30' E   | 4 chains 85 links |
| Y | S 10° 44' W 292.05 feet | S 10° 44' W  | 4 chains 43 links | 
| Z | S 53° 33' E             | S 64° 2' E   | 14 links (approx 9.5 feet, from Miller 1970/11) | 

The bearing for step Y is not explicitly stated in the footnote, and the Rice map is both difficult to read, and also, as already proven, cannot be correct anyway, as the line it depicts as straight cannot be straight. Instead, I have borrowed Schlieder’s measurements of the same area that states the course in step Y is S 10° 43' 36" W true, which I have rounded slightly to S 10° 44' W for this purpose. I have also used Schlieder's distances for steps X and Y. Shlieder's measurement is equivalent to the 320 feet stated and also note that it is essentially equal to the 4 chains 83 links distance explicitly stated in steps 2 and 3 of the 1883 Mills’ Home deed description. 

The difference between the two distances (X and Y) is approximately 25 feet, which is the stated distance between the "center line of the highway" and both the iron pipe set by Miller in 1972 and the "highway monument" (Deeds 499/981). And of course, as before, step Z will be further adjusted to S 64° 30' E to properly align the road with the other surveys, and when mapped, roughly accounts for the 9.5 feet given by Miller. 

{{% fig "brookton/maps/surveys/t3" "800" /%}}

Overlaying the resulting pseudo-survey as well as the pseudo-survey based on the original 1869 description onto Miller at point C as described, shows many points of alignment:

{{% fig "brookton/maps/surveys/1869-t3-overlaid-miller" "800" /%}}

Also on Schlieder:

{{% fig "brookton/maps/surveys/1869-t3-overlaid-schlieder" "800" /%}}

An explanation for the differences between point C in 1869 and Tract III will be proposed further below.

It seems that the intention of the footnote is to reconcile Rice and Miller, however, as has been shown, the referenced Miller survey, verified by Schlieder, proves that the Rice survey was in error. 

Yet, during the 1992 sale of the home, despite clear documentary evidence contrary to its central premise, a boundary line/encroachment agreement was filed based on the Rice boundary line depicted.   

<figure>

Interestingly, in an updated version of the Schlieder survey included with the 1992 boundary line agreement, which still included the notes corroborating the Miller/Dalebrook survey, the iron pipes are no longer shown, even though they were clearly still present. 

{{% fig "brookton/maps/surveys/boundary-agreement-schlieder" "200" /%}}

An updated survey in 2023 found all iron pipes, including Miller's set pipe by the road, now bent, essentially confirming Miller 1970/11, but acknowledging that the lower iron pipe was itself not directly on the true line, a result of more accurate measuring technology used.

When I first moved to Mills' Home, there was a concrete highway marker, broken off from its base and lying on its side next to the utility pole on the shoulder of Brooktondale Road. While surveying the property in 2023, Lee Dresser attempted to locate the base of the highway monument, in the area of a hedgerow at that time, but he could not find it.

I should also point out that the 2023 Dresser survey states "this survey map prepared without benefit of an abstract of title provided, subject to any state of fact that an updated abstract of title may show." I was present that day and made available the abstract of title, but it was not consulted. As previously noted, the written legal description in my deed at that time still referenced the displaced highway marker that Rice set as the place of beginning.

I present a final theory to try to reconcile all of these circumstances. The 1869 and 1883 Mills' Home deed descriptions are slightly incompatible as my pseudo-surveys show, suggesting that either point C changed in the intervening time, or the road changed slightly, or a combination of both. (Or perhaps a simple error was made in one of the surveys.)

Comparing the two pseudo-surveys by overlaying them so that the road and the center of the mill race bridge align corroborates all points except B and C, forming parallel eastern boundary lines that differ by roughly 19 links or approximately 12 1/2 feet. 

{{% fig "brookton/maps/surveys/1883-overlaid-1869" "800" /%}}

Both Schlieder and Miller's measurements of the boundary line, 320 feet is 4 chains 85 links, similar to the 1883 distance in steps 2 and 3 of 4 chains 83 links. Overlaying 1883 and Tract III pseudo-surveys onto Miller and Schlieder so that the center line of the road and point C match as closely as possible, seems to provide a better fit than the same surveys above with the 1863 pseudo-survey overlaid:

{{% fig "brookton/maps/surveys/1883-t3-overlaid-miller" "800" /%}}
{{% fig "brookton/maps/surveys/1883-t3-overlaid-schlieder" "800" /%}}

Also on Dresser in 2023:

{{% fig "brookton/maps/surveys/1883-t3-overlaid-dresser" "800" /%}}

Overlaying only the 1869, 1883 and Tract III pseudo-surveys further suggests that Tract III may have been an attempt to account for the differences between the 1869 and 1883 Mills' Home descriptions. This may help explain why Rice thought the highway monument was a property marker despite the fact that it did not fall on a straight line with the iron pipes that were already present–which were apparently based on the 1883 description–and it may explain why Charles Vorhis felt entitled to add the footnote to the deed with Frank Proto (499/981): to reconcile the 1869 and 1883 Mills' Home deed descriptions and re-establish the presumed 1869 boundary line, after more than a century. If true, then the Dresser survey, which corroborates Miller and Schlieder, may not provide much new information, as it is only a slightly more accurate corroboration of their surveys. 

{{% fig "brookton/maps/surveys/1869-1883-t3" "800" /%}}

## 1869 and 1883 as Magnetic Bearings 

A Dalebrook appropriation map from 1963 suggests the possibility that the mill race bridge, and therefore, the boundary line shared by Mills' Home and Dalebrook, may be approximately 82 links or 54 feet to the east of where it has generally been interpreted to be.

{{% fig "brookton/maps/BF162361-001-map-565" "800" /%}}

Because the 1869 and 1883 descriptions use matching bearings for the eastern boundary line, I will reconcile the two descriptions by using a declination of **6°** for both, based on the table of magentic declinations already given, which should be adequate for my purposes. (There are 60 seconds in a minute and 60 minutes in a degree, so the difference in declination between the two dates is 1° 8', making the midpoint between the two measurements 6° 18' and I further rounded this down to 6° to match the precision of the original measurements, which do not specify minutes or seconds. )  

The 1869 Mills' home deed description, adjusted for magnetic declination:

<figure>

| Step | | Legal Description | |  <span style="white-space: nowrap">True Bearing</span> |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

| 5 | | Thence easterly along said center of road three chains & ten links to the place of beginning.| | S 64° 30' E |

Both pseudo-surveys combined come much closer to reconciling then the same pseudo-surveys above interpreted as true north, although they are still mathematically incompatible based on the known measurements for each:

{{% fig "brookton/maps/surveys/475-magnetic/mag-1883-overlaid-1869" "800" /%}}

I repeated the same technique of overlaying my pseudo-surveys onto the historical surveys using Brooktondale Road and the northeastern pipe as guides for scaling.

The overlay on Dresser is particularly interesting:

  - A dark blue, thick, dashed line, drawn between points C and D along the brow of the hill, roughly intersects the concrete highway monument on the brow of the hill that is represented in the 2023 survey.
  
  - When another dark blue, thick, dashed line is drawn perpendicular to Brooktondale Road, it shows that the place of beginning in 1869 is roughly in line with the southeastern corner of the original (and still current) footprint of Mills' Home. 

  - The stake at point B at the end of step 2 is deeper into the current Dalebrook parcel than expected, however, the line in step 2 in 1869 roughly intersects both the present location of the utility pole and the present location of the bent iron pipe found on the currently defined eastern property boundary. Note too that the lines representing steps 2 and 3 form a right angle.

  - The center of the mill race bridge, appears to fall in an area that in 2023, is between a utility pole and the bent pipe on the currently defined eastern property boundary. 

But ultimately, the preponderance of evidence strongly suggests the original deeds were intended to be true bearings, and traditionally, this is how they have been interpreted, ultimately based on the existence of two iron pipes that appear to have been set in 1883 or after, that are in a 9° line that seems to originate on the brow of the hill at the location of point C in 1883.Rice describes the lower of the two pipes as an "old iron pipe" in 1969.
