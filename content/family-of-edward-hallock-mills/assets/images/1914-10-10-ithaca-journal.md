    This is a reference to [Miss Margaret "Maggie" LaBar (1880-1979)](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/88609026/margaret-labar) of Danby who describes herself in the census as a "seamstress". Her name has several variations in spelling. In relation to the Mills' store, it is consistently spelled "La Barre" however, Margaret did many similar store displays in which her name is consisently spelled "LaBarr". The same is true of many of her mentions in the Danby gossip columns, where both "LaBarr" and "LaBar" are used. "LaBarr" is used in Margaret's own notices and advertisements: she advertised the sale of millinery supplies from her home in Danby, and she also owned a home that she rented. The intermixing of "LaBar" and "LaBarr" occur over many decades, and even her father's obituary spells the family name as "LaBarr". Yet the grave markers say "LABAR" and census data consisently show spelling/capitalization of "LaBar".
