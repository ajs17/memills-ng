  - From Historic Richmond Town: "This building was the home of Charles M. Pine and family in West New Brighton, Staten Island; it was previously the Swan Hotel. Mr. Pine and his son C. Theodore Pine operated a grocery and dry goods store on Richmond Terrace in West New Brighton. ...Original B&W print on cream cardboard mount with rounded corners and gold beveled edges. Front view of a two-story wooden house with two-story porch, spring eave roof, and clapboard siding. There is a picket fence in front of the house. Several steps lead up to the first-floor porch, which has vines growing on both sides. Both porches have narrow Doric style columns and railing with flat, shaped balusters. At right, a picket fence with an open gate leads into an area at the side of the house. A brick building is partially visible at far left. Handwritten inscription on reverse of mount: "Pine Residence / W.N.B. S.I. N.Y." Stamped inscription on reverse of mount: "C.M. STEINROCK, / BIRDSBORO, / BERKS CO., PA.""

  - The "brick building...partially visible at far left" is Charles Pine's grocery store, known at different times as Pine Hillyer & Co. and C. M. Pine & Son, where both Edward Mills and Bartlett Brown worked in the 1850's.
