Mr. W. B. Hallock, of Danby was in town to-day, driving a magnificent bay team of young horses, probably about six years old. Mr. H. is an expert in horseflesh, as a judge, trainer and fitter, and always has a stock of fine horses at this stables. The team on our streets to-day we understood is for sale.
