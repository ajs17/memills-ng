Adam Joseph Smith, born 13 Dec 1971, Hornell NY, was the youngest child of Jeffrey Smith Jr. and Bernice Lee Casinelli. 

Adam was raised in the Smith family home, West Main Street, Woodhull NY and attended schools in Addison NY. Like every member of the Smith family, Adam helped with the family business, H. P. Smith & Son, in various ways from a young age. As an older child, he followed in his older siblings' footsteps, working at the Woodhull Cemetery in the Summers, under the direction of the caretaker, their grandfather Emilio Casinelli, better known to his many friends as "Casey".

Adam attended the College of Agriculture and Life Sciences at Cornell University, where graphic design was one area of concentration. After graduating in 1994, he lived two years in Cheektowaga NY, and it was during this time that he saw new opportunities to apply his design and writing skills to the emerging World Wide Web, and subsequently returned to the family home in Woodhull for two years, during which time he obtained his Master's degree from Syracuse University part-time, and simultaneously managed a printing shop in Corning NY full-time. His studies at Syracuse focused on emerging information technology, and Adam began to rigorously teach himself computer programming, a prior hobby. 

Adam then returned to the Ithaca area and worked 24 years for Cornell Universty in several departments including central information technologies and the library system, first at Albert R. Mann Library and then in the central library information technology department located in John M. Olin Library. His primarily roles were software developer, project manager, and supervisor.  

In addition to his normal employment, Adam did freelance work, both graphic design and computer programming, over many years in his spare time. He also started several businesses, the most significant of which was the tourism marketing firm, The Finger Lakes Beer Trail.

Adam had no children. He was a life-long learner and enjoyed being physically active. He lived many years in quiet solitude at The Mills Place, Brookon NY, where his ashes will be scattered on the hill above.

My property is at 475 Brooktondale Rd, Brooktondale, NY 14817, tax map ID: 11.-1-16. In the 1860's it was subdivided from the property next door to the east, and it is that boundary line that is in question. The property next door is currently Dalebrook Apartments, but was originally a grist mill, its address is 487 Brooktondale Road, Brooktondale, NY 14817, tax map ID: 11.-1-15, owned currently by Frank Proto. As you will see, Brooktondale Road used to be called Creek Road, Route 330, and Cooks Corners-Brookton Highway, or a variation of that.

Here is a summary of my deeds back to the beginning, I believe. Those deeds listed below starting with "*" contain survey maps.

  * My current deed. 

January 2023: A question regarding the eastern boundary line with Dalebrook:

    A. Starting with an updated survey of my property prepared by Howard Schlieder for Deeds 577, p1058 from 1980, two eastern property lines are shown, and subsequently, Deeds 683, p70 from 1992 contains an updated survey still showing both lines along with a boundary line agreement between Frank Proto, owner of Dalebrook then and now, and previous owners of my property, Larry and Janet Lattin, acknowledging a shed existing at that time that is thought (incorrectly, as I will show) to now be over the property line. Both of these lines still appear on my current survey, and the shed still exists in the same footprint presently. 

    B. However, the following three surveys taken together prove very clearly that the boundary line agreement incorrectly identified the true boundary line:

        1. Gordon Rice, 482/529 (# 18987), survey of my property,
        2. Howard Schlieder, 577/1060 survey of my property that shows the same boundary lines as Howard Schlieder 683/71 in the subsequent boundary line agreement, and
        3. Thomas Miller, 1970/11, survey of Dalebrook apartments, the adjoining property.

    C. The explanation for the two boundary lines is given in a note on the two Schlieder surveys mentioned above which reads:
    
        1. "This map is made to certify that the undersigned has examined a survey by Gordon E. Rice (18987) & found the easterly course different than that found on a survey of lands of Frank P. Proto, by Thomas Miller, in 1970. The latter survey was found to be correct." Note that "1970" is not referencing a year, but a book and page that directly cites the Thomas Miller survey of Dalebrook.

        3. The note quoted above unequivocally says that the Dalebrook survey--"the latter survey", "by Thomas Miller in 1970"--is correct, and further, a note on the easternmost boundary line on the updated Schlieder surveys further clarifies that it is the "property line as of survey in caroline 1970 pg 11", which is an unequivocal citation to the Miller survey that corroborates that this easternmost line is correct.
    
        4. Miller (1970/11) indicates the boundary line begins near Brooktondale Road with a "pipe set" and then intersects two symbols labelled "old pipe" in a straight line, and a "h'w'y mon" is several feet to the west of the "pipe set". Schlieder 577/1060 also indicates three "I.P. (found)", at those exact locations and in a straight line, with a "stone mon" several feet to the west of the iron pipe nearest the road.

        5. Clearly, Gordon Rice mistook what he labelled as a "con mon" (Miller's "h'w'y mon", and Schlieder's "stone mon") as the boundary marker, and missed the iron pipe a few feet to the east that was provably still present at the time he prepared the survey, and he apparently either didn't remeasure the distances to discover the error, or he remeasured and dismissed the fact that it is physically impossible to draw a straight line from the "con mon" through the other two iron pipes as his survey indicates. A boundary line beginning from the "con mon" would have to initially run northeast to intersect the second iron pipe, then turn to the northwest at the second pipe to be able to intersect the third and final pipe on the ridge. 

        6. This is precisely the issue that Howard Schlieder identified and corrected very clearly starting with 577/1060, as he corroborates three "I.P (found)" is at the same locations as Thomas Miller (1970/11). He indicates the "stone mon" in the same place that Rice indicates the "con mon" and that Miller indicates a "h'w'y mon". And Schlieder makes it unequivocal with multiple specific notes, that the iron pipes and not the "monument" show the true line.

        7. Further proof that Schlieder's and Miller's pipes are the same pipes in the same locations can be verified by the distance of the boundary line to a "large oak tree" that is a few feet inside the easternmost boundary line on both of my updated Schlieder surveys mentioned above, and which is further corroborated by the Miller survey. The Rice boundary line that begins from the "con mon" is shown intersecting the oak tree. 

        8. To summarize: During the 1992 sale of the home, the Lattin's attorney made a very basic mistake reading the Schlieder survey, incorrectly interpreting which line on the Schlieder survey is the true eastern boundary line, and as a result, the boundary line agreement is provably invalid based on the documentary evidence.

Interestingly, the lower two iron pipes indicated on the 577/1060 Schlieder survey are absent from the updated version in the boundary line agreement 683/71.

How was this missed by the lawyers? By Frank?
