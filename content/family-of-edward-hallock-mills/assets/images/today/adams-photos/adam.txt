Adam Joseph Smith, born 13 Dec 1971, Hornell NY, was the youngest child of Jeffrey Smith Jr. and Bernice Lee Casinelli. 

Adam was raised in the Smith family home, West Main Street, Woodhull NY and attended schools in Addison NY. Like every member of the Smith family, Adam helped with the family business, H. P. Smith & Son, in various ways from a young age. As an older child, he followed in his older siblings' footsteps, working at the Woodhull Cemetery in the Summers, under the direction of the caretaker, their grandfather Emilio Casinelli, better known to his many friends as "Casey".

Adam attended the College of Agriculture and Life Sciences at Cornell University, where graphic design was one area of concentration. After graduating in 1994, he lived two years in Cheektowaga NY, and it was during this time that he saw new opportunities to apply his design and writing skills to the emerging World Wide Web, and subsequently returned to the family home in Woodhull for two years, during which time he obtained his Master's degree from Syracuse University part-time, and simultaneously managed a printing shop in Corning NY full-time. His studies at Syracuse focused on emerging information technology, and Adam began to rigorously teach himself computer programming, a prior hobby. 

Adam then returned to the Ithaca area and worked 24 years for Cornell Universty in several departments including central information technologies and the library system, first at Albert R. Mann Library and then in the central library information technology department located in John M. Olin Library. His primarily roles were software developer, project manager, and supervisor.  

In addition to his normal employment, Adam did freelance work, both graphic design and computer programming, over many years in his spare time. He also started several businesses, the most significant of which was the tourism marketing firm, The Finger Lakes Beer Trail.

Adam had no children. He was a life-long learner and enjoyed being physically active. He lived many years in quiet solitude at The Mills Place, Brookon NY, where his ashes will be scattered on the hill above.

January 2023, eastern boundary line with Dalebrook:
    - Deeds 683, p70, from 1992, shows an updated survey along with a boundary line agreement between Frank Proto and previous owners, Larry and Janet Lattin. An existing shed is now over the updated property line. Both of these lines still appear on my current survey.
    - The explanation for the change in the notes of the survey says "found the easterly course different from that found on a survey of lands of Frank P. Proto, by Thomas Miller, in 1970. The latter survey was found to be correct."
    - The survey of Dalebrook filed in 1972 appears to be both the map being referred to in the note in my survey, as well as the most recent survey for Dalebrook, at least that I have found.
    - This Dalebrook survey appears to actually contradict my updated survey and shows the ORIGINAL property line, as can be seen unequivocally by the distance to the "large oak tree" near the line to the north noted on both maps, a tree that still exists I might add. The Dalebrook map shows the tree is west of the line by several feet, my current survey says it is on the line.
    - Note that the original property line on the Dalebrook survey intersects three "old pipes", including one near the edge of Brooktondale Road, a few feet east of an indicated "H'WY MON".
    - It appears that for some reason, the surveyor of my property used what is clearly described as a "H'WY MON" on the Dalebrook survey instead of the iron pipes previously used up to that point. As you can see, the only iron pipe acknowledged on my updated survey is the northernmost point on that boundary line and the oak tree has since been declared to be on the line.

What is going on here?
