Mary Ann Pine of Hempstead Long Island married Edward Hallock Mills, then of Castleton Staten Island, on 29 Dec 1850:

{{% fig "1851-01-03-Brooklyn-Daily-Eagle" "500" /%}}

All of the Mills children were born in [Staten Island]({{% ref "staten-island" %}}). Mary Ann's son [James Wheelock]({{% ref "mills-james-wheelock" %}}) died sometime between his baptism at the Reformed Dutch Church of Port Richmond, 31 Jul 1857 and before the United States Federal Census recorded 19 Jun 1860, when the family, including all of the Mills' children except James, was living with Bartlett Brown in a home adjoining a store Bartlett had recently purchased. 

Mary Ann's mother Rhoda died 26 Sep 1859, and on 31 Aug 1860, Mary Ann's sister Jerusha died. 

The family arrived in [Corfu NY]({{% ref "corfu-eh-mills-co" %}}) sometime between 01 Sept 1862 and 01 May 1863, where  Edward opened a new general store E. H. Mills & Co. and Mary Ann became a member of the Presbyterian Church of Corfu.

[Horace]({{% ref "mills-horace-f-1854" %}}) committed suicide in Corfu in Oct 
1876.

</div>

On 05 May 1877, Mary Ann's sister Abigail S. (Pine) Higbie died.

In Mar 1879, the family moved again, this time to Motts Corners, one of several earlier names for Brooktondale, where Edward restarted his grocery and dry goods business on his own as [E. H. Mills]({{% ref "me-mills" %}}). Both [Jonas]({{% ref "mills-jonas-e-1852" %}}) and [Emily]({{% ref "mills-mary-emily-1858" %}}) clerked for their father. 

Mary Ann joins what was then known as the Congregational Church of Motts Corners, presently Caroline Valley Community Church. In my review of the Congregational Church's membership rolls over the years, I have seen a number of instances in which members were officially added to church rolls many months after they had already been documented participating in church meetings, such as was the case with Lydia Forbes Robinson, who officially joined 10 Sep 1911 by letter from Tyrone Presbyterian Church in Weston NY, although she was living in Brookton and participating in church meetings with her husband and former Brookton pastor of the Congregational Church Reverend James Richards Robinson in 1910. So, perhaps Mary Ann was attending the church for some time prior to becoming an official member.

14 Mar 1880, Mary Ann's brother Samuel Mills Pine died. 14 October 1885, Mary Ann's son Jonas died after a brief illness.

07 Nov 1890, Mary Ann's sister Lois Almy (Pine) Snedeker died, leaving Charles Mills Pine the only other surviving child of Nicholas and Rhoda Pine, and in a six month period, Charles saw his son Charles Theodore Pine die on 26 May 1895, and then his sister Mary Ann.

## The Pines

I know of no formal histories or genealogies of the Pines, and initial searches starting with Mary Ann resulted in very little, so I have had to reconstruct this branch of the Pine tree from remaining documentary evidence. From the beginning, Charles M. Pine emerged as a central figure in the Mills' lives, and the last name struck me as a very big coincidence. I assumed he was related to Mary Ann, and probably quite closely, and that a closer examination of Charles' life would reveal much about the Mills. In time, I slowly compiled evidence proving that Mary Ann and Charles M. Pine were siblings. This fact alone explains much about the Mills' lives.

My ability to make this connection was initially hindered by the fact that of the handful of member-created genealogies on ancestry.com that included Charles and referenced his parents, all showed his parents as some variation of:

  -  [Charles L. Pine](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/58487321/charles-l-pine) (1785 to Apr 1853), whose relation to these Pines, if any, is presently unknown to me. 

  - Sarah Soper (1787 to ?), a person I have otherwise been unable to identify. Her age is listed as 78 in 1865.

(I will add that Charles M. Pines' entries on these genealogies were very incomplete, so he was obviously not the focus of these trees.)

Before moving onto what I believe is overwhelming evidence that Charles M. Pine is Mary Ann's brother, I will try to account for this apparent discrepancy with Charles' parents. It appears that the source of this error may be these entries in the 1865 New York State Census:

{{% fig "pine/1865-census-nys" "800" /%}}

I have also been unable to definitively identify Julia Soper, the 20 year old niece listed. There is a [Julia E. (Oakes) Soper](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/199166807/julia-e-soper) (Nov 1844 to 01 Apr 1910), born in Huntington, who, despite being the correct age, was married to Ezra Soper in 1867, so in the 1865 census she would not have the name Soper. 

I have a theory as to what might be happening, although with some noticeable counterpoints which I will also explore. Taking into account all the evidence I have available, I believe the most logical conclusion is that these two census entries in 1865 are referring to relatives of Charles Pine's wife [Elmira Jane (Loper) Pine](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/199952046/elmira-j-pine) (1813 to 07 Mar 1890):

{{% fig "staten-island/1835-02-21-charles-pine" "700" /%}}

Elmira's parents are:  

  - [Luther Loper](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/178362810/luther-loper) (04 Jun 1780 to 05 Apr 1856).

  - [Sarah (Bishop) Loper](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/141069644/sarah-loper) (1873 to 06 Jan 1870). Although the exact birthdates are unknown for both Sarah Loper and Sarah Soper (above), Sarah Loper's entry on FindAGrave states she died in her 86th year, which would make her approximately 82 in 1865, mismatching Sarah Soper's reported age in the 1865 census. And admittedly, the census entries certainly look more like "S" than "L".

All that said, I believe that the apparent "Sarah Soper", "mother" in the 1865 census above is Sarah Loper, Charles' mother-in-law, a widow at the time.

Elmira also had a niece, [Juliet (Loper) Shepard](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/36665791/juliet-shepard) (06 Jan 1845 to 02 Apr 1911), who is the daughter of Elmira's brother [Erastus Harvey Loper](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/33057122/erastus-harvey-loper) (1813 to 1860). Juliet was 20 in when the census was taken in 1865, matching the age of "Julia". Her obituaries state that "she was married to Mr. Shepard November 28, 1872", and so would still have the name Loper in 1865.

However, this may be somewhat obscured by two of Juliette's obituaries, that agree that "her early life was spent in New York City, and following the death of her father in 1860, the family moved to this place [Huntington]." Although, I would point out the vagueness of the relative time reference as well as the phrase "the family".

{{% fig "pine/1911-04-07-The-Suffolk-County-News-Sayville-NY-p4" "350" /%}}
</div>

To further support my theory, consider how similarly the name "Loper" when handwritten, even by Sarah Bishop herself, might easily be misinterpreted as "Soper":

{{% fig "pine/luther-loper-will-0-1" "800" /%}}

I now propose the true Pine genealogy, which I will show documentary evidence for further below, starting with Charles' and Mary Ann's grandparents:

  - Reuben Pine (1757 to 1827). 

  - [Jerusha (Mills) Pine](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/108776090/jerusha-pine) (16 Feb 1754 to 18 Nov 1846). Jerusha does not appear to be descended from Timothy Mills, although she may be a more distant relation under George Mills. If so, this would make Mary Ann a Mills by birth as well as by marriage.

Reuben and Jerusha's son Nicholas is Mary Ann's father:  

  - [Nicholas Ludlow Pine](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/108776395/nicholas-ludlow-pine) (? to 03 Sep 1828) 

  - [Rhoda (Seaman) Pine](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/108776309/rhoda-pine) (24 May 1786 to 26 Sep 1859).

<figure class="quote-only">

And Nicholas and Rhoda's children are:

  - Lois Almy (Pine) Snedeker (1805? to 07 Nov 1890) married William Snedeker (sometimes spelled "Snediker") in 1831 in South Hempstead. Their children include [Livingston Snedeker](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/180916294/livingston-snedeker) (May 1836 to 10 Aug 1906). 

  - [Abigail S. (Pine) Higbie](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/108830062/abby-s-higby) (? to 05 May 1877), spelled "Abby" on her tombstone, but commonly "Abbey" is used. Both Emily and Edward Mills appear to be mentioned in the Last Will and Testament of Abbey's husband Henry Higbie (? to 30 Oct 1881), dated 21 Oct 1881. Abbey and Henry were married in 1852 in South Hempstead.

  - [Jerusha Pine](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/108830285/jerusha-pine) (? to 31 Aug 1860) presumably named for her grandmother Jerusha (Mills) Pine listed above.

  - [Charles Mills Pine](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/199952123/charles-m-pine) (1812 to 08 Oct 1897), approximately 16 years old when his father died. That Charles' middle name is Mills is recorded in the index entry for his marriage to Elmira Loper in The New York Genealogical and Biographical Record (quarterly), 1922, selected extracts, p250, ancestry.com.

  - [Samuel Mills Pine](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/180274612/samuel-mills-pine) (26 Nov 1814 to 14 Mar 1880), 13 years old when his father died.

  - [Mary Ann (Pine) Mills](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/75958702/mary-ann-mills) (08 Feb 1819 to 28 Dec 1895), 8 years old when her father died.

Although some birthdates are missing, the birth order is likely correct based on the following, which is also the most complete documentary evidence of the family members, linking together Mary Ann, Charles M., and Samuel M., in the will of their father, Nicholas Pine:

When Edward married Hannah, an announcement in the Hempstead Sentinel states that Edward is "brother-in-law of the late Samuel M. Pine".
