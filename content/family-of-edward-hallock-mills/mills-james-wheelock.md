James Wheelock Mills (1856?, Staten Island NY to between 31 July 1857 and 19 Jun 1860, Staten Island NY). The only evidence I have found for the existence of James Wheelock Mills is his baptism record in the Reformed Dutch Church of Port Richmond, Staten Island NY.

Note several bounding dates for James' birth and death: he was presumably born sometime after Edward and Mary Ann married on 29 Dec 1850, and presumably died between the date of his baptism, 31 July 1857 , and before the United States Federal Census recorded on 19 Jun 1860 which includes the entire Mills family except James. As yet, I have not found the Mills family in the 1850 United States Federal Census or the 1855 New York State Census, but I suspect that he was born after the 1855 census.

The order of the Mills baptisms strongly suggests that James was born between Horace and Emily, and if James was born in 1856, this would evenly distribute the Mills births over the decade of 1850 to 1680, and would mean that his baptism was likely approximately a year after his birth, just as Emily's was in Nov 1859. So, I believe that James died under five years old. 

This would mean that the Mills left Staten Island within a few years of James' death, just as they left Corfu a few years after Horace's. If my speculation holds, even if James died at the latest possible time, Emily would likely have not had memories of him.
 
I cannot find any other records for James in *The Records of the Reformed Protestant Dutch Church on Staten Island*, including many pages of gravestone transcriptions, with the exception of the single baptism record shown above. I cannot find James on FindAGrave or Ancestry.  

I have reached out to both the Reformed Dutch Church and Moravian Cemetery (where I believe he is most likely to be buried) to get more information on James, especially birth and death dates, confirmation on where he is buried and a possible cause of death. 

Finally, the data above is taken from transcribed records of the Reformed Dutch Church. Therefore, I cannot rule out the possibility that "Wheelock" was mis-transcription from "Hallock".
