James Wheelock Mills (1856?, Staten Island NY to between 31 July 1857 and 19 Jun 1860, Staten Island NY). The only evidence I have found for the existence of James Wheelock Mills is his baptism record in the Reformed Dutch Church of Port Richmond, Staten Island NY.

Because this is the only information I presently have for James, I asked Kathleen Langdon of the Reformed Dutch Church to photograph the original entry, which she graciously agreed to do. This also verifies James' middle name, which I had initially speculated could be a mis-transcription of "Hallock".

The name "Wheelock" seems to be a very significant clue, as the tradition among the Mills was to reuse a relatively small number of names repeatedly through the generations, yet Wheelock is unique as far as I know. (Horace's middle name Franklin is rare, but not unique, in the Mills genealogy.) This is apparently a surname, likely of someone from either Staten Island or Hempstead, but as yet, I cannot link someone with this name to the Mills. 

Note several bounding dates for James' birth and death: he was presumably born sometime after Edward and Mary Ann married on 29 Dec 1850, and presumably died between the date of his baptism, 31 Jul 1857 , and before the United States Federal Census recorded on 19 Jun 1860 which includes the entire Mills family except James. As yet, I have not found the Mills family in the 1850 United States Federal Census or the 1855 New York State Census, but I suspect that he was born after the 1855 census.

The order of the Mills baptisms strongly suggests that James was born between Horace and Emily, and if James was born in 1856, this would evenly distribute the Mills births over the decade of 1850 to 1680, and would mean that his baptism was likely approximately a year after his birth, just as Emily's was in Nov 1859. So, I believe that James died under five years old. 

This would mean that the Mills left Staten Island within a few years of James' death, just as they left Corfu a few years after Horace's. If my speculation holds, even if James died at the latest possible time, Emily would likely have not had memories of him.
 
I cannot find any other records for James in *The Records of the Reformed Protestant Dutch Church on Staten Island*, including many pages of gravestone transcriptions, with the exception of the single baptism record shown above. Kathleen Langdon from the Reformed Dutch Church performed an independent search and also could not find him. Finally, I have also examined the First of Staten Island/Stapleton records on Ancestry.com, and I did not find the Mills there. 

I have not found James in any records on FindAGrave, FamilySearch, or Ancestry.  

Decades after the Mills left Staten Island, members of Charles Pine's family were buried in Moravian Cemetery in New Dorp.

Moravian Cemetery, located at 2205 Richmond Road, opened in 1740 and is the largest and oldest active cemetery on Staten Island.
</p>
<p>
In what was a purely farming community, the 113-acre (46 ha) cemetery was originally made available as a free cemetery for the public in order to discourage families from using farm burial plots. The Moravian Cemetery is the burial place for a number of famous Staten Islanders, including members of the Vanderbilt family.

The Vanderbilt family were members of the Reformed Dutch Church of Port Richmond, and Wikipedia also notes that “After the closure in the 1880s of the South Reformed Dutch Church in Richmondtown the graves of that church's graveyard were reinterred at Moravian.”

I contacted Moravian Cemetery, and they had no record of James there.

Friends of Abandoned Cemeteries of Staten Island (FACSI), have [lists](http://richmond.nygenweb.net/facsi/facsi_cemeteries_m2.shtml) of many Staten Island cemetery burials. There is a James C. W. Mills in Fountain Cemetery, who died at age 47 (FACSI ID 353), and a James Mills buried in the Fountain Cemetery Public Grounds who died 13 Jun 1889. There are also two unnamed Mills in Fountain Cemetery, in lot 080 and lot 095 (FACSI IDs 665 and 709 respectively), ages and death dates are unknown, but FACSI indicates that there are known burials in Fountain Cemetery from the 1860's, so these last two cannot be ruled out.

Staten Island Cemetery about 1847 and Trinity Cemetery about 1800 both are located in West New Brighton.

...It is very difficult to find a burial from 1850 if it is not on any known burial list. The original records from Fountain & Staten Island cemetery are old and brittle. The burials prior to 1880 were not well kept and it seems semi literate recordings. There are very few documented deaths at that time as well. No death certificates were issued.

Children were not always buried by name. Staten Island Cemetery has an area for less expensive child burials, they are recorded as "lot of 5 childs" or Mrs. Mills child, John M's child, etc. If the child you are seeking was buried there, no exact record will be found.

Trinity would later be called Church of the Ascension. 

FACSI also notes a number of burials identified simply as being on "Van Street". No Mills are listed there, and the dates of the burials at that location were decades after the Mills left Staten Island.  

The Beers map of Staten Island show that the two most likely burial places for James (assuming that the Reformed Dutch Church burial ground is ruled out), Staten Island Cemetery and Trinity Chapel/Church of the Ascension, are clustered together, along with Fountain Cemetery, near Pine, Hillyer & Co. general store, where Edward was presumably employed.

Finally, Samuel J. Wood Library at Weill Cornell Medicine has records starting from 1854 from the Nursery and Child’s Hospital, and I contacted them about a search for James. This was a unlikelihood anyway, and became moot as even to search for him, they required the very information I was looking for: exact date of death, death certificate, etc., and even then, I would have to sign and agreement to de-identify the information, defeating the purpose.

(The Staten Island “country branch” of the hospital didn’t open until 1869.)
