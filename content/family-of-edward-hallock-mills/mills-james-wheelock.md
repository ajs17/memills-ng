James Wheelock Mills (1856?, Staten Island NY to between 31 July 1857 and 19 Jun 1860, Staten Island NY). The only evidence I have found for the existence of James Wheelock Mills is his baptism record in the Reformed Dutch Church of Port Richmond, Staten Island NY.

Because this is the only information I presently have for James, I asked Kathleen Langdon of the Reformed Dutch Church to photograph the original entry, which she graciously agreed to do. This also verifies James' middle name, which I had initially speculated could be a mis-transcription of "Hallock".

Note several bounding dates for James' birth and death: he was presumably born sometime after Edward and Mary Ann married on 29 Dec 1850, and presumably died between the date of his baptism, 31 Jul 1857 , and before the United States Federal Census recorded on 19 Jun 1860 which includes the entire Mills family except James. As yet, I have not found the Mills family in the 1850 United States Federal Census or the 1855 New York State Census, but I suspect that he was born after the 1855 census.

The order of the Mills baptisms strongly suggests that James was born between Horace and Emily, and if James was born in 1856, this would evenly distribute the Mills births over the decade of 1850 to 1680, and would mean that his baptism was likely approximately a year after his birth, just as Emily's was in Nov 1859. So, I believe that James died under five years old. 

This would mean that the Mills left Staten Island within a few years of James' death, just as they left Corfu a few years after Horace's. If my speculation holds, even if James died at the latest possible time, Emily would likely have not had memories of him.
 
I cannot find any other records for James in *The Records of the Reformed Protestant Dutch Church on Staten Island*, including many pages of gravestone transcriptions, with the exception of the single baptism record shown above. I cannot find James on FindAGrave or Ancestry.  

I am attempting to get more information on James, especially birth and death dates, confirmation on where he is buried and a possible cause of death. I have reached out to both the Reformed Dutch Church and Moravian Cemetery, the two most likely places for James to be buried. Upon inquiring, Moravian Cemetery did not have a record for James. I have looked through transcriptions of the Reformed Church's graveyard and could not find an entry for James. Kathleen Langdon from the Reformed Dutch Church performed an independent search and also could not find him. Finally, I have also examined the First of Staten Island/Stapleton records on Ancestry.com, and I did not find the Mills there. 

I expect to find James on Staten Island, however, other logical places to look include Hempstead (Mary Ann's original home) and Mills Pond (Edward's original home).

Finally, I had initially speculated that perhaps James' middle name was a mis-transcription of "Hallock" but the photographed original entries show it is indeed Wheelock. Although there is perhaps a non-zero chance that the name was a mis-recording of Hallock, that is mere speculation. Assuming Wheelock is correct, this may be a very significant clue, as the tradition among the Mills was to reuse a relatively small number of names repeatedly through the generations, yet Wheelock is unique as far as I know. (Horace's middle name Franklin is rare, but not unique, in the Mills genealogy.)

Samuel J. Wood Library at Weill Cornell Medicine has records starting from 1854 from the Nursery and Child’s Hospital, and I contacted them about a search for James. This was a unlikelihood anyway, and became moot as to search, they required the very information I was looking for: exact date of death, death certificate, etc., and even then, I would have to sign and agreement to de-identify the information, defeating the purpose.

(The Staten Island “country branch” of the hospital didn’t open until 1869.)




Staten Island Cemetery about 1847 and Trinity Cemetery about 1800 both are located in West New Brighton.

It is very difficult to find a burial from 1850 if it is not on any known burial list. The original records from Fountain & Staten Island cemetery are old and brittle. The burials prior to 1880 were not well kept and it seems semi literate recordings. There are very few documented deaths at that time as well. No death certificates were issued.

Children were not always buried by name. Staten Island Cemetery has an area for less expensive child burials, they are recorded as "lot of 5 childs" or Mrs. Mills child, John M's child, etc. If the child you are seeking was buried there, no exact record will be found.

According to [information compiled by FACSI](http://www.nygenweb.net/richmond/cemeteries.html), Church of the Ascension Cemetery, located at “Richmond Terrace adjoining Staten Island Cemetery, between Tompkins Court and Alaska Street, West Brighton, (formerly Castleton)” contains known burials from 1802 to 1860. 


Moravian Cemetery, located at 2205 Richmond Road, opened in 1740 and is the largest and oldest active cemetery on Staten Island.

<blockquote>
In what was a purely farming community, the 113-acre (46 ha) cemetery was originally made available as a free cemetery for the public in order to discourage families from using farm burial plots. The Moravian Cemetery is the burial place for a number of famous Staten Islanders, including members of the Vanderbilt family.

The Vanderbilt family were members of the Reformed Dutch Church of Port Richmond, and Wikipedia also notes that “After the closure in the 1880s of the South Reformed Dutch Church in Richmondtown the graves of that church's graveyard were reinterred at Moravian.” Charles Pine and his family are also buried at Moravian, however, these burials took place decades after the Mills had left Staten Island.
