James Wheelock Mills (1856?, Staten Island NY to between 31 July 1857 and 19 Jun 1860, Staten Island NY). The only evidence I have found for the existence of James Wheelock Mills is his baptism record in the Reformed Dutch Church of Port Richmond, Staten Island NY.

Because this is the only information I presently have for James, I asked Kathleen Langdon of the Reformed Dutch Church to photograph the original entry, which she graciously agreed to do. This also verifies James' middle name, which I had initially speculated could be a mis-transcription of "Hallock".

Note several bounding dates for James' birth and death: he was presumably born sometime after Edward and Mary Ann married on 29 Dec 1850, and presumably died between the date of his baptism, 31 Jul 1857 , and before the United States Federal Census recorded on 19 Jun 1860 which includes the entire Mills family except James. As yet, I have not found the Mills family in the 1850 United States Federal Census or the 1855 New York State Census, but I suspect that he was born after the 1855 census.

The order of the Mills baptisms strongly suggests that James was born between Horace and Emily, and if James was born in 1856, this would evenly distribute the Mills births over the decade of 1850 to 1680, and would mean that his baptism was likely approximately a year after his birth, just as Emily's was in Nov 1859. So, I believe that James died under five years old. 

This would mean that the Mills left Staten Island within a few years of James' death, just as they left Corfu a few years after Horace's. If my speculation holds, even if James died at the latest possible time, Emily would likely have not had memories of him.
 
I cannot find any other records for James in *The Records of the Reformed Protestant Dutch Church on Staten Island*, including many pages of gravestone transcriptions, with the exception of the single baptism record shown above. I cannot find James on FindAGrave or Ancestry.  

I am attempting to get more information on James, especially birth and death dates, confirmation on where he is buried and a possible cause of death. I have reached out to both the Reformed Dutch Church and Moravian Cemetery, the two most likely places for James to be buried. Upon inquiring, Moravian Cemetery did not have a record for James. I have looked through transcriptions of the Reformed Church's graveyard and could not find an entry for James. Kathleen Langdon from the Reformed Dutch Church performed an independent search and also could not find him. Finally, I have also examined the First of Staten Island/Stapleton records on Ancestry.com, and I did not find the Mills there. 

I expect to find James on Staten Island, however, other logical places to look include Hempstead (Mary Ann's original home) and Mills Pond (Edward's original home).

Finally, I had initially speculated that perhaps James' middle name was a mis-transcription of "Hallock" but the photographed original entries show it is indeed Wheelock. Although there is perhaps a non-zero chance that the name was a mis-recording of Hallock, that is mere speculation. Assuming Wheelock is correct, this may be a very significant clue, as the tradition among the Mills was to reuse a relatively small number of names repeatedly through the generations, yet Wheelock is unique as far as I know. (Horace's middle name Franklin is rare, but not unique, in the Mills genealogy.)
