This publication attempts to document all extant information on the family of Edward H. Mills (1819 to 1908), with particular emphasis on Emily Mills (1858 to 1937) and the family's time in Brooktondale (formerly known as Brookton, and before that, Mott's Corners), a hamlet located in the town of Caroline, Tompkins County NY.

[Edward](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/75958691/edward-h-mills), [Mary Ann](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/75958702/mary-ann-mills), [Jonas](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/75958930/jonas-e-mills ) and [Horace](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/75958913/horace-f-mills) are interred at Evergreen Hill Cemetery, 112 Alleghany Rd, Corfu NY 14036.

James is presumably buried on Staten Island, although I have not yet found him. James is not at Moravian Cemetery, based on an inquiry with that office. The Reformed Dutch Church of Port Richmond is also being searched.

Warren, Alanna Congdon, Rob Bernhardt, Lois Lounsbery, Bea Raponi, Emily Adams, Bill Besemer, Mike Scaglione, Elaine Sapp, Pastor Kayti Dean and the council of Caroline Valley Community Church, Southworth Library, Jen Shulman, Bernard Vascotto, Nancy Conod, Ruth Ellis, Eric Huber, Cynthia Van Ness, Adam Rubin, Debra Rogers, Kathleen Langdon, Jacqueline Igliozzi, Annie Doubleday. 

In gratitude to those throughout the years who specifically preserved precious memories of Emily: Gertrude Conant, E. D. Shurter, Jessie Brewer, and Molly Adams.

And finally, the living former owners of 475 Brooktondale Road who have patiently entertained my curiosity: Clara and Luke Jones, Larry and Janet Lattin, and Andrea Talmadge and John Callaghan.
